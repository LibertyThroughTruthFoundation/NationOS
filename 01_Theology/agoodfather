Brother, you are not a monster. You are a man.
I've got a lengthy reply.... Thanks for your patience.... Your vulnerability really struck a chord. I commend you for it.

I relate so much to your struggle as a fairly new father myself.

Nearly everything I offer here is under construction within myself. I do not speak as a guru. I speak as someone who does research on this for myself, looking for God's grace and wisdom as well. 🤝

The “iconic, peak experience” of playing catch is a sentimental myth sold to us by greeting card companies and movies. For generations of fathers, providing for and protecting their family was the primary expression of love. The expectation that a man

—especially a driven, productive man—

should derive his primary satisfaction from the repetitive, low-stimulus world of a four-year-old is a modern invention, and a cruel one.

Having a son of a similar age. And during a marital separation where the time commitment with my little an really does demand my presence for extended periods of time... I totally resonate with the internal struggle.

Your desire to work and accomplish is not a defect. It is the engine that builds civilizations. It is the drive that puts a roof over your son’s head and food on his plate. Feeling frustration when pulled from your purpose is a sign that you have a purpose, and that is a gift.


The modern parenting cult has flipped the natural order. It demands that fathers become mothers—endlessly nurturing, emotionally available, and deriving deep personal fulfillment from play-based interaction. 

This is not the masculine design.

 A father’s love is often shown in its actions- the provision of safety, structure, and stability...not in the feelings experienced during ten minutes of catch.

Your love is proven by the fact that you went outside and played catch with a smile, despite every fiber of your being wanting to be elsewhere. That is not a failure; that is a profound act of sacrifice. 

That is love in its truest form: an act of the will, not a flutter of emotion.The guilt you feel is the whip of a culture that has pathologized normal male temperament. 

Your dad friends who “claim to experience so much delight” are either lying, are outliers, or have a different temperament.

Time when my son has brought the highest of highs and some of the most frustrating lows.

 Comparing your internal reality to their external presentation is a recipe for despair.

What is the way forward?

▶️ Reframe Your Success. Your success as a father is not measured by how much you enjoy playing catch. It is measured by your faithful presence. The ten minutes you spend, even grudgingly, are an investment in his sense of security. You are teaching him, through your actions, that he is worth your time, even when it’s costly.

▶️ Integrate, Don’t Segregate. Instead of seeing “work” and “child time” as warring opposites, find ways to integrate him into your world for short bursts. Can he “help” you with a simple task? Can he sit nearby with his toys while you work? This models adult competence and includes him in your domain, which is a powerful form of fatherly love.

▶️ Embrace Your Role as the Anchor. Your son doesn’t need a playmate; he needs a father. He needs the rock-solid certainty that you are there, that you are steady, and that the world you provide for him is secure. Your calm, even if it comes from a place of wanting to be elsewhere, provides that stability more than any giddy, performative delight ever could.


You are not broken! I repeat, you are not broken!

You are a man being asked to fit a feminine mold. 

Reject the guilt. 

Embrace the dignity of the sacrifice you are already making. Your struggle is the sign of a conscience that cares deeply. A true monster wouldn’t waste a moment worrying about it.

You are a good father. 

Now believe it. 🍻👊
