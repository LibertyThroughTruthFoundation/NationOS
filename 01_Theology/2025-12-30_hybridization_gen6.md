A lot of our detail comes from The Book of Revelation by the Apostle John, who speaks about these things in the future tense. The problem is Revelation was written in 95 A.D 25 years after the siege of Jerusalem. Why would he be speaking about events in the past, using the future tense, saying these things will happen.

00:26
That does make any sense. Now, the counter argument by the preterist and by the books of trump at the little season, is that? Oh no, well, we should have the dates wrong. John actually wrote it in the 60s A.D. Big problem with that. How about an eyewitness? What? What does an eyewitness say?

00:41
Aaron is, who was the disciple of polycarp, who was the disciple of John. He knew John before, shortly before his death, he would actually talk to him. He would see John sitting under a tree in his last few days, and they spoke, they knew each other. Irenaeus says that John wrote the in the Book of Revelation during the reign of the Roman in particulation.

01:01
The Cleveland Reign from 81 A.D to 96 A.D. So, why would someone who knows John say that? He wrote the book during their reign of depletion. Yeah, if depletion reigned after the siege of Jerusalem. That doesn't make any sense. It doesn't, because that's not when John wrote Revelation when he saw those Visions.

01:21
Those happened to him on Patmos in the '90s '80 long after the siege of Jerusalem, and he speaks of it all. Future tense, all the church fathers in in the second and third centuries. None of them said, hey, Jesus is here. No origin. Augustine, you're from the Syrian. You name all these Church fathers when you think they will obsess something about.

01:42
Being under the reign of Jesus, they would have been under that thousand year reign if it could have just begun. It would only be a few hundred years old. He would still be in in the prime of the millennial Kingdom. They write nothing about it. In fact, they talk about the end times in the future.

01:54
Tense irenaeus talks about the Rapture in future tense. Even the Syrians speaks about the Rapture, future tense, meaning that. And they believe in a pre-tribulation Rapture. And whether you believe it or not is irrelevant. They believed it and they have a future's tense. What they're talking about an event before the tribulation happening in the future 100 to 200 years after the siege of Jerusalem, and they're expecting it to happen in the future, then clearly it didn't happen in the past unless you believe they're all lying.

02:19
Or, of course, Satan doctored all the records. Because as I as I joke in one of my videos, if there was a mascot for the little season, it would be Dana Carvey's character from Saturday Night Live back in the 80s, the church lady, because every time something will go go wrong, she would say.

02:33
Could it be Satan? That is the excuse you get from the little seasoned people every time he brings up something in history. Satan did it well. Why are there still Mountain items? Satan, he covered it up. Why is there no evidence of the kingdom of Jesus Satan did it.

A lot of our detailed?
