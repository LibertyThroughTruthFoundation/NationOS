Absolutely. Here is the reconstruction of that analysis into a powerful, public-facing X post designed to equip the saints and expose the deception. It's framed as a warning and a call to discernment.

**X Post Draft:**

This video is a case study in spiritual warfare. It blends fascinating archaeology with an ancient, soul-destroying lie. 🧵👇

The goal is sophisticated: to replace the Gospel with a "higher," more "enlightened" narrative.

Here’s the breakdown:

1/ **The "Divine Council" TRUTH vs. The Pagan LIE:**
YES, the Bible shows a Divine Council (Ps 82).
NO, Yahweh is not just one god among many.
This video twists truth into polytheism, denying Yahweh as the Supreme Creator (Deut 32:8-9). If true, the Cross is meaningless. ⚔️

2/ **The "Enki vs. Enlil" Gnostic Heresy:**
This repackages the oldest lie: that God is a tyrant and the Serpent was the enlightener.
It frames obedience as oppression and sin as liberation.
This destroys the concept of the Fall and our need for a Savior. It’s the spirit of Antichrist. 🐍

3/ **The Attack on the Resurrection:**
Suggesting a "spiritual"而非physical resurrection guts the Gospel (1 Cor 15).
If Christ wasn't physically raised, our faith is in vain. This turns a historical event into a mere philosophy. 💀

**The Geopolitical Angle:**
Why the push for these Sumerian/Babylonian narratives now? The powers of darkness are rallying around their ancient spiritual stronghold (Babylon/Iraq). They are building a "scholarly" foundation for a global spirituality that explicitly rejects Christ.

**The Bottom Line:**
This isn't about hidden knowledge. It's about the same old serpent offering a different gospel. Don't be deceived.

Anatomize the arguments. Test the spirits. Hold fast to the Sovereign Lord. The truth hasn't changed.
