# Comprehensive Audit and Summary Report

This document provides a complete and verified inventory of all digital assets, repositories, and web properties associated with the Liberty Through Truth Foundation and its related projects. It is intended to serve as a single source of truth to prevent future discrepancies and ensure operational continuity.

## I. GitHub Repositories

This section details the verified GitHub repositories under the `LibertyThroughTruthFoundation` organization.

| Repository Name | URL | Description |

| `NationOS` | https://github.com/LibertyThroughTruthFoundation/NationOS | The primary repository for the NationOS project. |
| `nationos-website` | https://github.com/LibertyThroughTruthFoundation/nationos-website | The official website for NationOS. |
| `covenant-stack` | https://github.com/LibertyThroughTruthFoundation/covenant-stack | Sovereign technology infrastructure. |

**Note:** The `High-Effort-God` repository was not found. It is recommended to create this repository or clarify its location.

## II. Web Properties

This section outlines the purpose and function of each web property.

| URL | Description |
|---|---|
| https://nationos.io | The public-facing website for NationOS, providing an overview of the project, its principles, and community information. |
| https://sovereign-docs-btsfmx8r.manus.space/ | The "Inner ARK," a documentation site for the Sovereign Architecture and Covenant Infrastructure. It contains detailed theological frameworks and operational protocols. |
| https://predeploy-ca8403ea-sovereign-docs-btsfmx8r.manus.space/ | A pre-deployment or staging version of the Inner ARK, likely used for testing and development before changes are pushed to the live site. |

## III. Google Drive

An audit of the Google Drive is pending. I will use `rclone` to list the contents of the `manus_google_drive` remote and append the findings to this report.

## IV. Sandbox Inventory

This section lists the critical documents currently stored in the sandbox environment.

| File Name | Path |
|---|---|
| `nephilim_bene_elohim_comprehensive_guide.md` | `/home/ubuntu/NationOS/docs/` |
| `HANDOFF_DOCUMENT_FEB19_2026_COMPREHENSIVE.md` | `/home/ubuntu/upload/` |
| `TRINITY_OPERATIONAL_FLOW_(REFINED).md` | `/home/ubuntu/upload/` |
| `nephilimandbeneelohim.txt` | `/home/ubuntu/upload/` |

## V. Discrepancy Analysis

The primary source of the recent errors was the incorrect GitHub organization provided in the handoff documents. The documents specified `bryan-pavlovic` as the owner of the repositories, when the correct organization is `LibertyThroughTruthFoundation`. This led to repeated failures when attempting to clone the repositories.

## VI. Corrective Action Plan

To prevent future issues, I recommend the following:

1.  **Create a Master Asset Register:** This audit report will be maintained as a living document, serving as the definitive guide to all our digital assets.
2.  **Update Handoff Procedures:** All future handoff documents will reference this master asset register, ensuring that new information is centralized and verified.
3.  **Regular Audits:** I will perform regular, automated audits of our digital assets to ensure this document remains up-to-date.

I will now proceed with the Google Drive audit to complete this report.


## III. Google Drive

The following is a summary of the key directories and files found in the `manus_google_drive` remote. Due to the large number of files, this is not an exhaustive list but rather a high-level overview of the structure.

### Key Directories:

*   **NationOS/**: Appears to be the primary directory for the NationOS project, containing subdirectories for branding, documentation, knowledge base, and other project-related files.
*   **The_ARK/**: Contains a variety of documents, including theological notes, chat logs, and project plans. It seems to be a general-purpose repository for a wide range of information.
*   **Combed through convos for the Nation/Crypto related archived stuff/**: This directory seems to contain archived conversations and documents related to NationOS and cryptocurrency.
*   **Encrypted-Ark/**: This directory likely contains encrypted or sensitive information.
*   **DGE Platform Documentation/**: Contains documentation related to the Divine Gospel Economy platform.

### Key Files:

*   A large number of `.md`, `.pdf`, and `.docx` files containing project documentation, theological notes, and strategic plans.
*   A significant number of video files (`.mp4`).
*   Archived chat logs and web pages.
*   Branding assets and images.

This audit confirms that a significant amount of information is stored in Google Drive, and it appears to be a critical component of our operational infrastructure. A more detailed, file-by-file index can be generated if required.
