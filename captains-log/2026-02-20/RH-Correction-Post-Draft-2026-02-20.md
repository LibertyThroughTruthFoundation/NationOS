Here is the draft for the actionable post. It gives people a clear, targeted list of where to go and what to do to correct the record.

```
Richard is right. The misinformation is rampant, but we can correct it. Here is a battle plan for anyone who wants to help set the record straight. Let's give them a head start. 👇

**1. WIKIPEDIA: THE EMPTY PAGE**

*   **The Problem:** There is NO Wikipedia page for Richard Heart. It was deleted. A draft exists but was declined. Convicted fraudsters have pages, but a man who won his case against the SEC is erased.
*   **The Mission:** We need editors to resubmit the draft. The draft itself is a good start, but it needs to be framed correctly. The dismissal of the SEC case is the lede, not a footnote. The philanthropy needs to be highlighted. The sources are there (Reuters, CoinDesk, CourtListener). We just need to do the work.
*   **The Link:** `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draft:Richard_Heart`

**2. GROKIPEDIA: THE AI ECHO CHAMBER**

*   **The Problem:** The PulseChain page on Grokipedia is a mess of biased language. It calls HEX a "Ponzi-like scheme" and repeats the SEC's disproven allegations as fact. It's a perfect example of the AI misinformation loop.
*   **The Mission:** We need to flag the "Controversies" section for its biased, prosecution-first framing. We need to request a dedicated Richard Heart page that is factually accurate. We need to point out that the Interpol assault charge was dropped and the SENS philanthropy is missing.
*   **The Link:** `https://grokipedia.com/page/PulseChain`

**3. THE SEC & YAHOO FINANCE: THE ZOMBIE ARTICLES**

*   **The Problem:** The original SEC press release from July 2023 is still live with NO update that the case was dismissed. Yahoo Finance and other outlets still have their original articles up with no correction.
*   **The Mission:** We need to flood the SEC with public comments and FOIA requests to update their press release. We need to use the "submit a correction" feature on Yahoo Finance and other news sites to demand they update their outdated stories.
*   **The Links:**
    *   SEC Press Release: `https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2023-143`
    *   Yahoo Finance: `https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hex-founder-used-investor-funds-193204010.html`

**4. INTERPOL: THE DROPPED CHARGE**

*   **The Problem:** The most serious and damaging allegation on the Interpol Red Notice, the assault charge, was DROPPED. It was fabricated. Yet, outlets like Protos still call him a "fugitive" and bury this fact.
*   **The Mission:** We need to amplify this. Every time someone mentions the Interpol notice, we need to reply with the fact that the assault charge was dropped. This is a massive credibility blow to the entire case against him.

This is how we fight. Not with anger, but with facts. With sources. With persistence. Let's get to work. 🙏
