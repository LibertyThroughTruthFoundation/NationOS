## THE EXCHANGE

### @DuRtY_Crypto (Original Post)
> "PulseChain. A pDAI relic has been discovered, a video post from November 9, 2024. You will recognize many familiar faces. You can sense the excitement and joy, this is the power of green candles. Lots of them are still here, but many have flipped bearish."

### @0xGshep (Reply)
> "Too many people flip-flop in crypto and forget why they invested in the first place. Conviction disappears on every red candle, panic sets in... then the first green candle shows up and suddenly it's euphoria again. Welcome to crypto 🤣🤣"

### @BryanPavlovic (Your Testimony)
> "Its tough...I too have 'flip-flopped' in a way... I no longer use traditional analysis to determine my asset and income choices or strategies... I once had high conviction plays that are no longer high conviction plays... So I've made adjustments if that's considered flip-flop. So be it.
>
> Pulse chain is my preferred and home sovereignty blockchain. The RH cores, Atropa, pDAI, pWBTC, pWETH, pTGC, are my preferred assets ... Core DEXs along with LibertySwapFi and others are 'my core' preferences for protocols, defi etc.
>
> Yet I remain blockchain agnostic (in my tool selection and what I choose to build on/with), and I don't put my trust in the tools themselves. I use the tools to steward my trust and faith in community and shared values and value creation.
>
> This is definitely an evolution in my approach to crypto as a whole... It been a humbling journey... It makes sense to some, it's confusing to some, some abhor it, some resonate with it... I'm unapologetic in it. 🤝🔥✝️⚔️🌴"
