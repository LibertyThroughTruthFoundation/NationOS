# CHURCH GATES PROTOCOL
## Spirit-Led Assembly Discernment & Titus 1:12 Pattern Recognition

**Hebrew:** שַׁעֲרֵי כְּנֵסֶת רוּחַ (Sha'arei Keneset Ruaḥ: Spirit Assembly Gates)  
**Spanish:** Protocolo de Puertas de Iglesia  
**English:** Church Gates Protocol

**Date:** January 26, 2026  
**Framework:** Titus 1:12-14 (Cretan Test) + John 10:27 (Shepherd's Voice) + Hebrews 10:25 (Assembly) + James 4:15 (Lord Willing)

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This protocol addresses the discernment required for **local church commitment** when the Spirit has not yet given clear directive. Bryan's question: **Should I commit to consistent Sunday attendance at Family of God church when (1) Pastor Brian's response pattern shows potential Titus 1:12 markers, (2) I haven't received green light from Father for traditional commitment, and (3) my work/lifestyle doesn't conform to tradition?**

**Answer:** **Not Binary** - Church commitment requires Spirit-led discernment (John 10:27), not tradition-driven obligation. Continue Hebrews 10:25 assembly (fellowship) while testing patterns (Titus 1:12) and awaiting Father's directive. Flexibility is righteous when grounded in James 4:15 ("Lord willing").

---

## PART 1: SITUATION ANALYSIS

### Bryan's Context

1. **Apprehension for Commitment:** No clear green light from Father for traditional Sunday commitment
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Pastor Brian's text response ignored content, focused on attendance
3. **Non-Traditional Work:** Foundation projects, Cynthia relationship, flexible schedule
4. **Discernment Process:** "Still feeling out who's who and how people are going to respond"

### Pastor Brian Text Exchange

**Bryan (1/25, 17:47):**
> "Hope you enjoyed your Sunday... Sharing some artwork I was working on today for my foundation projects. Talk with you soon. Have a great night"

**Brian (1/25, 17:50):**
> "Hello didn't see you at church today everything ok?"

**Bryan (1/25, 17:51):**
> "Yes sir...settling adjustments... No problems"

**Bryan (1/25, 17:53):**
> "Thanks for asking 🙏"

### Pattern Analysis

**Observation:** Pastor Brian's response **ignored the content** (artwork, foundation projects) and **focused on attendance absence**.

**Potential Interpretations:**
1. **Pastoral Care:** Genuine concern for member's wellbeing (positive)
2. **Attendance Focus:** Institutional priority over relational engagement (neutral)
3. **Titus 1:12 Pattern:** Content-ignoring, tradition-enforcing (concerning)

**Assessment:** Too early to determine. Single data point. Continue observation.

## PART 2: BIBLICAL FRAMEWORK

### Hebrews 10:25 - Assembly Command

**Greek:** μὴ ἐγκαταλείποντες τὴν ἐπισυναγωγὴν ἑαυτῶν (mē enkataleipontes tēn episunagōgēn heautōn)  
**Translation:** "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together"

**Full Verse:**
> "Not giving up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but encouraging one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching." (Hebrews 10:25)

**Key Terms:**
1. **ἐπισυναγωγή (episunagōgē):** Gathering together, assembly, congregation
2. **ἐγκαταλείπω (enkataleiō):** Forsake, abandon, desert

**Application:**
- **Command:** Do not forsake assembly (gathering with believers)
- **Purpose:** Mutual encouragement (παρακαλέω - parakaleō)
- **Timing:** "All the more as you see the Day approaching"

**Important Distinction:**
- **Assembly ≠ Sunday Service:** ἐπισυναγωγή refers to **gathering of believers**, not specifically Sunday institutional service
- **Flexibility:** Assembly can occur in homes (Acts 2:46), on various days (Acts 20:7), in various forms
- **Core Requirement:** Regular fellowship with believers for mutual encouragement

**Conclusion:** Hebrews 10:25 requires **assembly** (fellowship), not necessarily **traditional Sunday attendance**.

---

### John 10:27 - Shepherd's Voice

**Greek:** τὰ πρόβατα τὰ ἐμὰ τῆς φωνῆς μου ἀκούουσιν (ta probata ta ema tēs phōnēs mou akouousin)  
**Translation:** "My sheep hear my voice"

**Full Verse:**
> "My sheep listen to my voice; I know them, and they follow me." (John 10:27)

**Key Terms:**
1. **ἀκούω (akouō):** Hear, listen, understand, obey
2. **φωνή (phōnē):** Voice, sound, utterance

**Application:**
- **Spirit-Led:** Sheep follow Shepherd's voice, not institutional tradition
- **Personal Relationship:** "I know them" - Individual guidance from Father
- **Discernment:** Hearing requires listening (active spiritual discipline)

**Bryan's Experience:**
- **Listening:** "I'm still feeling out who's who"
- **No Green Light:** "I also do not believe yet the Father has said I want you committing to this church body more faithfully"
- **Flexibility:** "Lord willing" approach (James 4:15)

**Conclusion:** Spirit-led discernment (John 10:27) takes precedence over tradition-driven obligation.

---

### James 4:15 - Lord Willing

**Greek:** ἐὰν ὁ κύριος θελήσῃ (ean ho kyrios thelēsē)  
**Translation:** "If the Lord wills"

**Full Verse:**
> "Instead, you ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.'" (James 4:15)

**Context (James 4:13-16):**
> "Now listen, you who say, 'Today or tomorrow we will go to this or that city, spend a year there, carry on business and make money.' Why, you do not even know what will happen tomorrow... Instead, you ought to say, 'If it is the Lord's will, we will live and do this or that.' As it is, you boast in your arrogant schemes. All such boasting is evil."

**Application:**
- **Humility:** Plans subject to Father's will, not human certainty
- **Flexibility:** "Lord willing" is righteous posture, not lack of commitment
- **Bryan's Approach:** "My desire was to go to that church service... at the same time letting her know that there was flexibility"

**Conclusion:** James 4:15 "Lord willing" flexibility is **righteous**, not irresponsible.

---

### Titus 1:12-14 - Cretan Test

**Greek:** Κρῆτες ἀεὶ ψεῦσται, κακὰ θηρία, γαστέρες ἀργαί (Krētes aei pseustai, kaka thēria, gasteres argai)  
**Translation:** "Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons"

**Full Passage:**
> "One of Crete's own prophets has said it: 'Cretans are always liars, evil brutes, lazy gluttons.' This saying is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith and will pay no attention to Jewish myths or to the merely human commands of those who reject the truth." (Titus 1:12-14)

**Key Characteristics:**
1. **Always Liars (ψεῦσται):** Deception, exaggeration, unreliability
2. **Evil Brutes (κακὰ θηρία):** Harmful, destructive behavior
3. **Lazy Gluttons (γαστέρες ἀργαί):** Self-indulgent, no effort

**Application to Church Discernment:**
- **Pattern Recognition:** Identify Cretan patterns in leadership/congregation
- **Sharp Rebuke:** Titus 1:13 - "Rebuke them sharply, so that they will be sound in the faith"
- **Human Commands:** Titus 1:14 - "Pay no attention to... merely human commands"

**Pastor Brian Assessment:**
- **Single Data Point:** One text exchange (insufficient for pattern)
- **Potential Concern:** Content-ignoring, attendance-focusing response
- **Time Test:** Continue observation before judgment

**Conclusion:** Apply Titus 1:12 test **over time**, not from single interaction.

---

### Acts 5:29 - Obey God Not Men

**Greek:** πειθαρχεῖν δεῖ θεῷ μᾶλλον ἢ ἀνθρώποις (peitharchein dei theō mallon ē anthrōpois)  
**Translation:** "We must obey God rather than men"

**Application:**
- **When Applicable:** Human authority contradicts God's command
- **Church Context:** If church tradition contradicts Spirit's leading, obey Spirit
- **Bryan's Situation:** No contradiction yet - just discernment process

**Conclusion:** Acts 5:29 applies when tradition **contradicts** Spirit's leading, not merely when tradition is **inconvenient**.

---

## PART 3: DISCERNMENT FRAMEWORK

### Three-Gate Church Commitment Test

**Gate 1: Spirit's Voice (John 10:27)**
- **Question:** Has Father given clear directive for this church body?
- **Bryan's Status:** No green light yet ("I also do not believe yet the Father has said...")
- **Action:** Continue listening, await directive

**Gate 2: Assembly Obedience (Hebrews 10:25)**
- **Question:** Am I forsaking assembly (fellowship with believers)?
- **Bryan's Status:** No - Fellowship at padel courts, Family of God visits, Cynthia relationship
- **Action:** Maintain assembly in various forms, not just Sunday service

**Gate 3: Pattern Recognition (Titus 1:12)**
- **Question:** Does leadership/congregation show Cretan patterns?
- **Bryan's Status:** Single data point (Pastor Brian text), insufficient for judgment
- **Action:** Continue observation over time

### Decision Matrix

| Scenario | Spirit Directive | Assembly Maintained | Cretan Pattern | Action |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Current** | No clear green light | Yes (various forms) | Insufficient data | Continue discernment, flexible attendance |
| **Green Light** | Yes, commit | Yes | No | Commit to consistent attendance |
| **Red Flag** | No, withdraw | Yes (elsewhere) | Yes (confirmed) | Withdraw, find alternative assembly |
| **Neutral** | No directive | Yes | No | Continue flexible engagement |

**Bryan's Current Position:** **Neutral** - No Spirit directive, assembly maintained, insufficient Cretan data. Continue flexible engagement.

## PART 4: PASTOR BRIAN PATTERN ANALYSIS

### Single Data Point Assessment

**Text Exchange Analysis:**

**Bryan's Message:**
- **Content:** Artwork, foundation projects, Sunday work
- **Tone:** Friendly, sharing, relational
- **Implicit:** "I was productive on Sunday, not at church"

**Pastor Brian's Response:**
- **Content:** Attendance inquiry only
- **Tone:** Pastoral concern (surface level)
- **Implicit:** "Why weren't you at church?"

**Possible Interpretations:**

**Interpretation A: Pastoral Care (Positive)**
- Genuine concern for member's wellbeing
- Checking in after absence
- Normal pastoral behavior

**Interpretation B: Institutional Priority (Neutral)**
- Church attendance as primary metric
- Content secondary to presence
- Common institutional pattern

**Interpretation C: Titus 1:12 Marker (Concerning)**
- Ignoring substantive content (foundation work)
- Focusing on tradition compliance
- "Human commands" (Titus 1:14) over relational engagement

### Time Test Required

**Proverbs 18:17:**
> "In a lawsuit the first to speak seems right, until someone comes to cross-examine."

**Application:**
- **Single Data Point:** Insufficient for judgment
- **Time Test:** Observe pattern over multiple interactions
- **Grace:** Assume positive intent until pattern emerges

**Recommended Observation Period:**
- **3-5 Interactions:** Sufficient to identify pattern
- **Content vs. Attendance:** Track whether responses engage content or focus on attendance
- **Relational vs. Institutional:** Track whether engagement is personal or programmatic

---

## PART 5: CYNTHIA RELATIONSHIP INTEGRATION

### Song of Songs 1:2 - Delight

**Hebrew:** יִשָּׁקֵנִי מִנְּשִׁיקוֹת פִּיהוּ (Yishaqeni mineshiqot pihu)  
**Translation:** "Let him kiss me with the kisses of his mouth"

**Application:**
- **Relational Priority:** Cynthia relationship is legitimate covenant pursuit
- **Flexibility:** "We're still figuring each other out"
- **Lord Willing:** Sunday flexibility honors relational discernment

### Church + Relationship Balance

**Bryan's Approach:**
> "My desire was to go to that church service because she also asked about going to church with me there, while at the same time letting her know that there was flexibility"

**Assessment:**
- **Righteous:** Desire for church + flexibility for relationship
- **James 4:15:** "Lord willing" approach to both
- **Ephesians 5:** Potential wife-finding takes priority over institutional attendance

**Conclusion:** Cynthia relationship discernment is **legitimate priority** alongside church discernment.
