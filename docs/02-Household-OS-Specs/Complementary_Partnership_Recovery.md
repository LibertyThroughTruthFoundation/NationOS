## Why the Complementary Partnership Appears to Fail (And How to Recover It)

### I. The Doubt: "It Doesn't Work Anymore"

Many men and women in the modern world look at the biblical model of complementary partnership (Ephesians 5, the Archer/Bow metaphor) and conclude that it is a relic of a bygone era. They see broken marriages, feminist rebellion, male abdication, and government overreach, and they conclude that the model itself is flawed.

This doubt is understandable, but it is based on a misdiagnosis of the problem.

### II. The Diagnosis: Rarity is Not Falsehood

The rarity of successful complementary partnerships is not evidence that the model is false. It is evidence that the model has been **corrupted and abandoned**. The fact that something is broken does not mean it was never true; it means it needs to be recovered.

The root causes of this breakdown are:

1.  **Egalitarianism:** The lie that men and women are interchangeable, and that their God-ordained roles are oppressive.
2.  **Feminism:** The rebellion against male headship and the embrace of female dominance.
3.  **Male Abdication:** Men who have abandoned their roles as leaders, protectors, and providers, leaving a vacuum that has been filled by the state.
4.  **Government Overreach:** The welfare state has replaced the husband as the provider, creating a dependency that undermines the family unit.

This is the **Cretan theater** (Titus 1:12) in action. The system has actively worked to destroy the complementary partnership, not because it doesn't work, but because it *does* work and threatens the system's control.

### III. The Foundation: God's Unchanging Word

Truth is not determined by cultural consensus or empirical observation of a fallen world. Truth is determined by God's unchanging Word. The architecture of the complementary partnership is timeless and eternal, even if the current generation has abandoned it.

The Five Immutable Creeds are the bedrock of this understanding. To doubt the complementary partnership is to doubt one of the creeds, and that doubt is based on cultural observation, not Scripture.

### IV. Biblical Examples of Complementary Partnerships

-   **Abraham & Sarah:** Abraham led the family, and Sarah supported him, even when it was difficult (Genesis 12).
-   **Isaac & Rebekah:** Rebekah was a strong and capable woman who was a true partner to Isaac (Genesis 24).
-   **Boaz & Ruth:** Boaz was a kinsman-redeemer who protected and provided for Ruth, and Ruth was a loyal and virtuous woman who respected and honored him (Ruth 2-4).
-   **Aquila & Priscilla:** A husband and wife team who were partners in ministry and business, and who were both highly respected in the early church (Acts 18, Romans 16).

### V. Modern Examples of Complementary Partnerships

-   **Alex & Leila Hormozi (Acquisition.com):** A modern, secular example of a complementary partnership in business. Alex focuses on marketing and sales, while Leila manages operations and execution. They are 50/50 partners who view themselves as "fullbacks" in their business, fully engaged and equal in decision-making.

### VI. The Recovery: How to Rebuild the Complementary Partnership

1.  **Repentance:** Men must repent of their abdication and reclaim their roles as leaders, protectors, and providers. Women must repent of their rebellion and embrace their roles as helpers and supporters.
2.  **Re-education:** We must re-educate ourselves and our children on the biblical model of the complementary partnership, and reject the lies of egalitarianism and feminism.
3.  **Reconstruction:** We must rebuild our families and communities on the foundation of God's Word, and create a culture that honors and supports the complementary partnership.

This is not an easy path, but it is the only path to true freedom and flourishing. The complementary partnership is not a relic of the past; it is the key to our future.
