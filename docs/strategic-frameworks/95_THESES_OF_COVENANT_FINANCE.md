**Thesis #91 - "The Great Commission of Crypto"**
- **The Lie:** The goal is to "orange pill" as many people as possible into crypto adoption.
- **The Covenant Truth:** **"The Digital Great Commission."** The goal is to make disciples of all nations, teaching them to observe all that Christ has commanded, using technology as a tool for that mission.
- **The Result:** Aligns the technological project with the ultimate purpose of glorifying God and advancing His kingdom.

**Thesis #92 - "Technology as Savior"**
- **The Lie:** The right code, the right protocol, or the right innovation will save humanity.
- **The Covenant Truth:** **"Christ Alone Saves."** Technology is a tool that can serve good or evil. Only Jesus Christ can redeem and restore humanity.
- **The Result:** Prevents the idolatry of technology and keeps our ultimate hope rightly placed.

**Thesis #93 - "The Primacy of the Local"**
- **The Lie:** Digital global communities can replace the need for physical, local embodiment.
- **The Covenant Truth:** **"Digital Serves Local."** Digital tools exist to strengthen families, churches, and neighborhoods—the fundamental cells of society. The screen must never supersede the face-to-face.
- **The Result:** Prevents the atrophy of local community and ensures technology serves human relationship rather than replacing it.

**Thesis #94 - "The Law of the Covenant"**
- **The Lie:** Smart contracts and algorithms can automate and enforce complex human agreements without need for wisdom.
- **The Covenant Truth:** **"The Spirit Gives Life."** The letter of the code kills, but the Spirit gives life. All agreements must be governed by the spirit of the covenant, which requires wisdom, mercy, and ongoing relationship.
- **The Result:** Prevents the hardening of agreements into inhuman, unbreakable cages and allows for the application of grace and wisdom in every situation.

**Thesis #95 - "In God We Trust"**
- **The Lie:** "In code we trust" is the final declaration of independence from flawed human institutions.
- **The Covenant Truth:** **"In God We Trust."** Our final declaration is not of independence, but of dependence—on God alone. All our systems, codes, and communities are subject to His rule and righteous judgment. We are not our own saviors.
- **The Result:** Humility replaces hubris. The entire technological project is placed under the authority of the One who alone can truly liberate. This is the foundation upon which a truly free and righteous digital civilization can be built.
