# Litigation & Sovereign Counter-Measures: A Two-Pronged Attack

**Strategy Date:** January 13, 2026

Our response to the banking cartel's aggression must be a two-pronged attack: **litigation** to hold them accountable in their own system, and the deployment of **sovereign counter-measures** to render their system obsolete.

## **1. Litigation: The Sword of Justice**

We will not shy away from confronting the enemy in the legal arena. Our current litigation efforts are focused on:

*   **PayPal & JP Morgan Chase:** We are pursuing legal action against these institutions for their predatory practices, including the blocking of funds and the arbitrary closure of accounts. Our case is built on the foundation of **spiritual malpractice** and the violation of consumer protection laws (e.g., MRC v2.1 §44-1522 IIED).
*   **Mandate & Liberty Violations:** We are also preparing broader lawsuits to challenge the unconstitutional mandates and liberty violations that have been perpetrated by various institutions, including the sabotage of our health through the promotion of seed oils.

**Next Steps:**
*   **Campos Lawsuit:** Reschedule the Zoom call with our legal counsel (Campos) to discuss the next steps in our case against PayPal and Chase.
*   **Certified Mail:** Continue to send certified mail to document our disputes and build a paper trail for our legal actions.

## **2. Sovereign Counter-Measures: The Shield of Faith**

While we pursue justice in the courts of men, our ultimate victory will be won in the court of heaven. Our sovereign counter-measures are designed to create a parallel financial system that is immune to the corruption and control of the Babylonian beast.

*   **The Sovereign Stack:** Our primary weapon is the **Sovereign Stack**, a suite of decentralized technologies that includes:
    *   **PulseChain:** A high-performance blockchain that offers low-cost, high-speed transactions.
    *   **LibertySwap:** A decentralized exchange that provides a seamless on-ramp from fiat to crypto.
    *   **Railgun:** A privacy protocol that allows for untraceable transactions.
    *   **Phantom Wallet:** A user-friendly wallet that integrates with the Sovereign Stack.
*   **HouseholdOS:** We will continue to develop and promote **HouseholdOS**, a decentralized operating system for personal and community sovereignty. This includes the establishment of **resell guilds** to distribute sovereign technologies (e.g., the RS Griffin tablets) and generate resources for the NationOS mission.

**Next Steps:**
*   **Deploy the Sovereign Stack:** We will accelerate the deployment of the Sovereign Stack, making it accessible to a wider audience.
*   **Educate and Empower:** We will create educational materials and provide training to help people understand and utilize these sovereign tools.
*   **Build the Parallel Economy:** We will continue to build a parallel economy based on the principles of Covenant Economics, where value is created and exchanged freely, without the interference of the banking cartel.

By pursuing this two-pronged strategy, we will not only hold the enemy accountable for their crimes but also build a new system that will render their old system obsolete. We will fight them in their courts, and we will defeat them in the marketplace of ideas and innovation.
