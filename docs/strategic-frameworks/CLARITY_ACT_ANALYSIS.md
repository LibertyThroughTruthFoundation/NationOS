# CLARITY Act: A Declaration of War by the Banking Cartel

**Analysis Date:** January 13, 2026

## **1. The Core Threat: Banning Passive Stablecoin Yields**

The latest markup of the **CLARITY Act** represents a direct assault on the financial sovereignty of individuals. The proposed legislation includes a provision that would **ban passive stablecoin yields**, meaning users would no longer be able to earn interest simply by holding stablecoin balances. This is a strategic maneuver by the traditional banking industry to eliminate competition and re-intermediate the flow of capital in the digital asset space.

As highlighted by **Paul Grewal, Chief Legal Officer at Coinbase**, this is a "concerted effort on the part of the banking industry to... fundamentally entrench a competitive advantage." The banks intend to acquire these stablecoin yields for themselves, only offering them to users who are "active" and engaged in risk-based activities within their systems. This effectively transforms a passive, accessible yield opportunity into a gated, risk-managed product controlled by the very institutions we seek to escape.

## **2. The Illusion of "Compromise"**

**Patrick Wit**, Executive Director on the President's Council of Advisors for Digital Assets, has framed this as a necessary "compromise" to get the bill passed. However, this is a false narrative. Ceding ground on stablecoin yields is not a compromise; it is a surrender of the core principles of DeFi. It preserves the "intolerable" status quo, where the banks control the flow of capital and extract value from the system at the expense of individual users.

## **3. The Contradiction of "Progress"**

Senator **Cynthia Lummis** has urged the crypto community not to "retreat from our progress" on the CLARITY Act. However, the proposed ban on passive yields is a significant retreat. It is a step backward, not forward. The bill, in its current form, would hand a major victory to the banking cartel, undermining the very foundations of a decentralized financial future.

## **4. The Silver Lining: Self-Custody and DeFi Proliferation**

Despite the significant threat posed by the yield ban, the CLARITY Act does contain some positive provisions. It is expected to:

*   **Protect Self-Custody:** The bill is not expected to attack the right of individuals to self-custody their digital assets.
*   **Allow DeFi to Proliferate:** The bill is expected to include carve-outs that will allow DeFi to continue to grow and innovate.
*   **Classify Key Assets as Commodities:** The bill is expected to classify major cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, XRP, Solana, and others as commodities, which would provide regulatory clarity and allow for greater institutional investment.

## **5. The Sovereign Response**

While the political battle over the CLARITY Act is important, our primary focus must be on building and utilizing sovereign systems that are immune to such regulatory attacks. The integration of **LibertySwap V2 with Phantom Wallet** is a prime example of this. By creating a seamless, low-cost on-ramp from fiat to DeFi, we can bypass the banking cartel and their legislative machinations entirely.

Our path forward is clear: **build, educate, and empower.** We will continue to develop and promote sovereign financial tools while simultaneously pursuing legal action against the corrupt institutions that seek to maintain their illegitimate control over the global financial system.
