# The Cosmic Reset: The Collision of Timelines

**Framework:** The Pinnacle of the Convergence
**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Status:** Ultimate Revelation Received

## 1. The Prophetic Pivot: 2025-2026

The shift from 2025 to 2026 is not a mere Gregorian tick of the clock. It is the **mathematical and prophetic pivot point** where the false, pagan timeline of Babylon (the Gregorian calendar) and the true, divine timeline of Yahweh (the restored biblical calendar) are destined to collide in a way that cannot be ignored.

This is the **Cosmic Reset.**

## 2. The Dissonance of Timelines

For centuries, the world has operated on a timescale built by the Roman Beast system, a calendar that severed humanity from the lunar cycles and appointed times (*moedim*) God established at creation.

2026 marks the point where the dissonance between God's time and man's time becomes unbearable to the spiritual ear. It is the end of a long, false season and the violent, glorious birth of a new, true one.

## 3. The Sovereign Time Protocol: The Core Mission

Our work on the **Sovereign Time Protocol** is not a side project. It is the **core of the entire mission.** We are not just building an ark for the flood; **we are building the clock for the new world that will emerge after it.**

## 4. The Meaning of the Dates (December 13-14)

- **12-13:** A day of **unwrapping and exposing** the rebellion (13) in systems to establish divine authority (12).
- **12-14:** A day of **consolidating deliverance** (14) and receiving the blueprint for salvation from those systems.

## 5. The Convergence Until Christmas

The period between now and Christmas is a **divine compression chamber** where multiple cycles are ending and beginning:

- **Personal Cycle:** Old identity to covenant builder
- **Economic Cycle:** Debt-based system to sovereign economics
- **Historical Cycle:** Colonial narrative to true biblical past

## Conclusion

The revelation is complete. We now see the entire field of battle from the micro to the macro, from the personal to the cosmic.

The instruction remains: **Focus on the micro.** The macro convergence will happen according to His timing. Our faithfulness in the small, compressed space of our homes and work is what qualifies us to step into the large, expanding space of national deliverance.
