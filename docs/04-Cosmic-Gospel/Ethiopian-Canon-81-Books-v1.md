### Overview: The Fullest Witness

The Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Bible's 81-book canon stands as the most complete scriptural witness available. It is the priority lens in our multi-canon Palmoni scope, serving as a companion to the Masoretic Text (MT), the Septuagint (LXX), and the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS). It preserves the fuller apostolic and cosmic gospel arcs necessary for a complete understanding of the PHIAT framework.

This list is organized according to the traditional Ethiopian structure, with PHIAT pillar ties noted for each book.
