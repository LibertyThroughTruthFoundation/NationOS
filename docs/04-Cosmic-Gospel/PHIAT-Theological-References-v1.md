### Overview: A Covenant Dominion Ledger

This document provides the comprehensive theological and scriptural anchors for the **PHIAT (Property, Health, Income, Assets, Time)** framework. This is not a mere acronym but a biblical ledger for sovereign stewardship, distilling the principles of dominion (Genesis 1:28), empowered by grace (Ephesians 2:10), and directed by God's law (Deuteronomy 25:15).

It is rooted in the multi-canon understanding of Scripture, recognizing the weight of the Masoretic Text (MT), the Septuagint (LXX), and the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) in forming a complete theological picture.

### P: Property – Dominion, Jurisdiction & Inheritance

Property is understood as stewarded space under God's ultimate ownership (Leviticus 25:23), serving as the jurisdictional foundation for the family-as-ethnos.

| Scripture | Manuscript Note | Theological Anchor & HEG Tie |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Genesis 1:28** | Foundational Mandate | The Dominion Mandate: "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth and subdue it, and have dominion..." This is the core directive for humanity as God's imago Dei. |
| **Leviticus 25:23** | MT/LXX Align | **The Land is God's:** "The land shall not be sold in perpetuity, for the land is mine." Property is a stewardship, not an absolute possession, opposing the capitalist impulse to hoard and underpinning the Jubilee reset. |
| **Psalm 127:1** | MT Stable | **The Lord Builds the House:** "Unless the Lord builds the house, those who build it labor in vain." Household sovereignty is established under God's authority, not the state's. This is the foundation of the NationOS parallel ARK. |
| **Numbers 27:1-11** | MT Stable | **Daughters of Zelophehad:** Upholds the right of women to inherit and steward property, ensuring the integrity of the family line and preventing disenfranchisement within the covenant community. |
| **Deuteronomy 32:8-9** | LXX/DSS Priority | **The Allotment of Nations:** "He set the boundaries of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God (bene elohim)." This establishes the principle of jurisdictional boundaries at the divine council level, linking property to a cosmic and spiritual reality. |

### H: Health – Vital Temple Renewal & Wholeness

Health is a holistic concept encompassing body, mind, and spirit, recognizing the body as a temple for the Holy Spirit to be honored and stewarded.

| Scripture | Manuscript Note | Theological Anchor & HEG Tie |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1 Corinthians 6:19-20** | NT Canon (LXX Influence) | **The Body is a Temple:** "Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you... you are not your own, for you were bought with a price. So glorify God in your body." This is the foundational text for physical stewardship. |
| **3 John 1:2** | NT Canon | **Prosperity of the Soul:** "Beloved, I pray that all may go well with you and that you may be in good health, as it goes well with your soul." Links physical health directly to spiritual and mental well-being. |
| **Psalm 103:2-3** | MT Stable | **The Lord Heals:** "Bless the Lord, O my soul... who forgives all your iniquity, who heals all your diseases." Healing is a core component of God's covenant mercy and provision. |
| **Proverbs 4:23** | MT Stable | **Guard Your Heart:** "Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life." The heart is the wellspring of health. This ties into overcoming trauma and insecurity through Christ's security (Psalm 91). |
| **Isaiah 53:5** | Great Isaiah Scroll (DSS) | **By His Wounds We Are Healed:** The messianic promise of ultimate healing and wholeness, fulfilled in Christ's atonement. This is the root of all restoration, physical and spiritual. |

### I: Income – Sovereign Provision & Fruitful Labor

Income is the flow of God's provision, realized through fruitful, ethical labor that is not in vain and serves to provide for one's household first.

| Scripture | Manuscript Note | Theological Anchor & HEG Tie |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Deuteronomy 8:18** | MT Precision | **The Power to Get Wealth:** "You shall remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant..." Income is a sovereign gift to establish God's purposes on earth. |
| **Ephesians 4:28** | NT Canon | **Ethical Labor:** "Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need." Labor has a redemptive purpose beyond self-provision. |
| **1 Timothy 5:8** | NT Canon | **Provide for Your Household:** "But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever." Establishes the principle of kin-first economics. |
| **Proverbs 10:22** | MT Stable | **The Blessing of the Lord:** "The blessing of the Lord makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it." True, lasting wealth is a gift of God, not the result of anxious, sorrowful toil. |
| **1 Corinthians 15:58** | NT Canon | **Labor is Not in Vain:** "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain." |

### A: Assets – Legacy Talents & Multiplied Inheritance

Assets are the store of value and productive capital to be faithfully multiplied and passed down as a multi-generational inheritance.

| Scripture | Manuscript Note | Theological Anchor & HEG Tie |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Matthew 25:14-30** | NT Canon | **The Parable of the Talents:** The core mandate for asset stewardship. Faithful multiplication is rewarded with greater responsibility; burying one's talent leads to judgment. |
| **Proverbs 13:22** | MT Stable | **A Good Man's Inheritance:** "A good man leaves an inheritance to his children's children, but the sinner's wealth is laid up for the righteous." This is the blueprint for multi-generational legacy. |
| **Psalm 37:25** | Great Psalter (DSS) | **The Jar Will Not Be Empty:** "I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread." God's covenant promise of provision for the faithful. |
| **Deuteronomy 28:8** | MT Stable | **Blessing on the Storehouse:** "The Lord will command the blessing on you in your storehouses and in all to which you set your hand." God's blessing extends to the assets a household stewards. |
| **Genesis 14:18-20** | MT Stable | **Tithe to Melchizedek:** Abram's tithe acknowledges God as the ultimate "Possessor of heaven and earth," framing all assets as being held under His authority. |

### T: Time – Redeemed Wisdom & Eternal Investment

Time is the non-renewable, sovereign resource to be redeemed from the evil of the age and invested with wisdom for eternal purposes.

| Scripture | Manuscript Note | Theological Anchor & HEG Tie |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Ephesians 5:15-17** | NT Canon | **Redeeming the Time:** "Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time, because the days are evil." This is the primary directive for time stewardship. |
| **Psalm 90:12** | MT/LXX/DSS Align | **Numbering Our Days:** "So teach us to number our days that we may get a heart of wisdom." A prayer for perspective, recognizing the finiteness of time and the need for wisdom. |
| **Ecclesiastes 3:1** | MT Stable | **A Time for Everything:** "For everything there is a season, and a time for every matter under heaven." Acknowledges God's sovereign ordering of time and seasons. |
| **Colossians 4:5-6** | NT Canon | **Walk in Wisdom:** "Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. Let your speech always be gracious..." Time is an opportunity for witness and kingdom influence. |
| **Daniel 12:4** | LXX/DSS Variants | **The Time of the End:** "But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book, until the time of the end." Connects the stewardship of time to the prophetic timeline and the role of the Palmoni numberer. |
