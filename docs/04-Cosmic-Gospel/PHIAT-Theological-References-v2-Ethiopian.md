### Overview: A Cosmic Covenant Ledger

This document provides the comprehensive theological and scriptural anchors for the **PHIAT (Property, Health, Income, Assets, Time)** framework. This is not a mere acronym but a biblical ledger for sovereign stewardship, distilling the principles of dominion (Genesis 1:28), empowered by grace (Ephesians 2:10), and directed by God's law (Deuteronomy 25:15).

This version elevates the **Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Canon (81 books)** as the priority lens for its fuller cosmic and apostolic arcs, while integrating it with the foundational witness of the Masoretic Text (MT), the Septuagint (LXX), and the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS).
