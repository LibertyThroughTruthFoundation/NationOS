## 1. Overview: Consecrated Brand Anchors

This document canonizes the **12 Sovereign Emojis**, a set of consecrated brand anchors for the NationOS ecosystem. These are not talismans or charms for luck, but visual reminders of Christ's triumph, our covenant obligations, and the sovereign reality of the Kingdom. They are designed to contend against the visual idolatry of the present age and to serve as rallying points for the remnant.

Each emoji combination is anchored in scripture and tied to a core theological concept within the High-Effort God (HEG) framework. They are intended for use across all NationOS communications, from social media posts to internal documentation, to reinforce the covenant worldview.
