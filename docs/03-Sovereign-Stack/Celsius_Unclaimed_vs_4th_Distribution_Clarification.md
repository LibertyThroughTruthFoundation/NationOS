## I. The Two Separate Celsius Situations (CLARIFIED)

### **Situation 1: Unclaimed Property Forfeiture Warning (Email You Received)**

**What it is:**
- **You have unclaimed distribution funds** from previous Celsius distributions (1st, 2nd, or 3rd distribution)
- **You haven't successfully redeemed** one or more of your distributions yet
- **Forfeiture warning:** If you don't claim your funds by **January 29, 2027** (11:59 PM Eastern Time), your claim will be **forfeited** (you lose the money)

**What you need to do:**
- ✅ **You already did it:** Opened a support ticket at https://celsiusdistribution.stretto.com/support/tickets/new
- ✅ Selected: "I need to claim my potentially Unclaimed Property"
- ✅ Your ticket was created (green banner: "Your ticket has been created")

**What happens next:**
- Celsius Distributions Support will email you with instructions on how to claim your unclaimed distribution
- You'll need to verify your identity, connect PayPal account (or provide wallet addresses), and complete the claim process
- **Deadline:** January 29, 2027 (you have 1 year to complete the process)

**Key point:**
- **This is about PAST distributions (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) that you haven't claimed yet.**
- **This is NOT about the 4th distribution scheduled for February 2026.**

---

### **Situation 2: 4th Distribution Scheduled for February 2026 (YouTube Video)**

**What it is:**
- **New distribution** of $344.4 million scheduled for **February 2026**
- **7.2% of your claim** (bringing total cumulative recovery to **72.1%** of your claim value)
- **Largest distribution yet** (bigger than 2nd distribution $127M and 3rd distribution $220.6M)
- **Final Bitcoin distribution** (all future distributions will be in cash or stablecoins, no more ETH)

**Where the funds come from:**
- **Litigation proceeds:** $256.4 million
- **Disputed and contingent claims reserve:** $73.7 million
- **Forfeiture procedures:** $14.3 million (from creditors who forfeited their claims by not responding by March 31, 2025 deadline)

**What you need to do:**
- **Nothing yet.** The 4th distribution will be processed automatically using the same distribution agent (PayPal or Coinbase) that was used for your last successful distribution attempt.
- **If you successfully claimed your 1st, 2nd, or 3rd distribution:** The 4th distribution will be sent to the same PayPal account or wallet address automatically.
- **If you haven't successfully claimed any previous distribution:** You need to complete the unclaimed property claim process first (Situation 1 above).

**Key point:**
- **This is about a NEW distribution (4th) scheduled for February 2026.**
- **This is NOT about unclaimed property from past distributions.**

## II. The Key Distinction (SIMPLIFIED)

| **Aspect** | **Unclaimed Property Forfeiture (Email)** | **4th Distribution (February 2026)** |
|---|---|---|
| **What it is** | Past distributions (1st, 2nd, or 3rd) that you haven't claimed yet | New distribution (4th) scheduled for February 2026 |
| **Amount** | Unknown (depends on which past distributions you haven't claimed) | 7.2% of your claim ($344.4M total pool) |
| **Deadline** | January 29, 2027 (to avoid forfeiture) | No deadline (automatic distribution in February 2026) |
| **Action required** | ✅ Open support ticket (you already did this) | None (automatic, unless you haven't claimed any past distributions) |
| **What happens next** | Celsius Support will email you with instructions to claim your unclaimed funds | 4th distribution will be sent automatically to your PayPal or wallet (if you've successfully claimed past distributions) |

## III. Your Specific Situation (BRYAN)

### **Question 1: Which Past Distributions Have You Successfully Claimed?**

**To understand your situation, you need to know:**
- **Did you successfully claim the 1st distribution?** (Yes/No/Don't know)
- **Did you successfully claim the 2nd distribution?** (Yes/No/Don't know)
- **Did you successfully claim the 3rd distribution?** (Yes/No/Don't know)

**If you don't know:**
- Wait for Celsius Distributions Support to respond to your ticket
- They will tell you which distributions you haven't claimed yet
- They will tell you the total amount of your unclaimed funds

---

### **Question 2: How Much Crypto Did You Have on Celsius When It Went Bankrupt?**

**To estimate your total claim value, you need to know:**
- **How much BTC did you have on Celsius?** (e.g., 0.5 BTC)
- **How much ETH did you have on Celsius?** (e.g., 2 ETH)
- **How much stablecoins (USDC, USDT, etc.) did you have on Celsius?** (e.g., $5,000 USDC)

**If you don't know:**
- Wait for Celsius Distributions Support to respond to your ticket
- They will tell you your total claim value
- They will tell you how much you've received so far (if any)
- They will tell you how much you're owed from unclaimed distributions

---

### **Question 3: What Is Your Total Claim Value?**

**Based on the YouTube video:**
- **Total cumulative recovery so far:** 72.1% of your claim value (after 4th distribution in February 2026)
- **4th distribution:** 7.2% of your claim value

**Example:**
- If your total claim value is **$10,000** (based on the value of your crypto when Celsius went bankrupt):
  - **1st distribution:** ~20% = $2,000
  - **2nd distribution:** ~15% = $1,500
  - **3rd distribution:** ~30% = $3,000
  - **4th distribution:** 7.2% = $720
  - **Total cumulative recovery:** 72.1% = $7,210

**If you haven't claimed any of the past distributions:**
- You're owed **$7,210** (in the example above)
- You need to complete the unclaimed property claim process to receive it

**If you've claimed some of the past distributions but not all:**
- You're owed the unclaimed distributions only
- Example: If you claimed 1st and 2nd distributions ($2,000 + $1,500 = $3,500), but not 3rd distribution ($3,000), you're owed $3,000 from unclaimed property

## V. Father's Provision (DEUTERONOMY 8:18)

**Brother, this is ANOTHER provision from Father.**

**Celsius distributions are Father's provision:**
- **You had crypto on Celsius** (Father gave you power to get wealth, Deut 8:18)
- **Celsius went bankrupt** (Father allowed this for a reason, Rom 8:28)
- **Bankruptcy court approved distribution plan** (Father is restoring what was lost, Joel 2:25)
- **You're receiving 72.1% of your claim value** (Father is faithful, Psalm 37:25)

**This morning:**
- ❌ Heart ache (son/mom calls, Cynthia clarity, enemy doubt)
- ❌ Down to $300

**This afternoon:**
- ✅ Heather ALREADY retained lawyer (FREE for you, $0 instead of $349-$5,000+)
- ✅ Celsius unclaimed property claim (could be hundreds or thousands of dollars)
- ✅ Celsius 4th distribution scheduled for February 2026 (7.2% of your claim)
- ✅ $220 from mom (furniture sale split)

**Father is providing, brother.**

**Deuteronomy 8:18:**
> **"You shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day."**

**Psalm 37:25:**
> **"I have been young, and now am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his children begging for bread."**

**Matthew 6:33:**
> **"But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you."**
