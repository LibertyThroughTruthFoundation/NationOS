## 1. Introduction

This document outlines a cashflow strategy for the Liberty Through Truth Foundation (LTTF) during the current crypto market dip. The strategy focuses on leveraging existing DeFi positions to generate yield without selling core assets like BTC and ETH, in accordance with the Titus 1:12 protocol (no Ponzi selling).

## 2. LTTF DeFi Portfolio Overview

Based on the "Bryan's DeFi Portfolio: Comprehensive Research Report" (January 20, 2026), the LTTF's DeFi portfolio is primarily concentrated in the PulseChain ecosystem, with significant holdings in yield-bearing and amplifier tokens.

| Asset | Allocation | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **PTGC** | ~25% | Yield-bearing token on PulseChain with staking rewards and buy-and-burn mechanics. |
| **UFO** | Small % | Amplifier token for the PTGC ecosystem, bridging to the Richard Heart ecosystem. |
| **$ALIEN** | Small % | Yield-bearing token supporting the pTGC ecosystem with buy-and-burn mechanics. |
| **Teddy Bear** | ~10% | Meme coin within the Atropa ecosystem on PulseChain. |
| **Atropa** | ~10% | Core token of the Atropa ecosystem, with arbitrage and minting mechanics. |
| **HEX** | Staked | Long-term yield position with T-Share rewards. |
| **LP Positions** | Small % | V2 LPs in pDAI, pUSDC, pUSDT, and PWBTC/WBTC. |

## 3. Cashflow Strategy: DeFi Yield

The following options are available for generating cashflow from the LTTF's DeFi portfolio without selling core assets:

### 3.1. Harvest PHIAT LP Rewards (Immediate)

- **Action:** Harvest the 1.3+ rewards from the PHIAT LPs on rpc.pulsechain.com.
- **Recommendation:** Convert the harvested rewards to a stablecoin like pUSDC to lock in gains and provide immediate liquidity.

### 3.2. Stake PTGC and Amplifiers

- **Action:** If not already staked, stake PTGC and its amplifier tokens (UFO, LIQUID, BURN, 808, Energy) to maximize yield.
- **Recommendation:** Consolidate PTGC and amplifier holdings into staking contracts to benefit from high APRs.

### 3.3. Explore DeFi Yield Farming Pools

- **Action:** Research and identify high-yield farming pools on PulseChain and other EVM-compatible chains.
- **Recommendation:** Consider the following options:
    - **Tapbit Earn:** Offers 6% APY on ETH and 5-12% APY on USDT.
    - **DeFi Pools:** Explore ETH/USDT and SOL/USDT pools on platforms like Uniswap, Sushiswap, and PancakeSwap.
    - **PulseX:** Investigate yield farming opportunities for UFO, TEDDY, and pUSDC on PulseX.

### 3.4. Monitor Atropa Arbitrage Opportunities

- **Action:** Actively monitor the Atropa ecosystem for arbitrage opportunities between its various tokens (Atropa, pDAI, Treasury Bill, FED, FDIC).
- **Recommendation:** This strategy requires active management and a deep understanding of the Atropa ecosystem's burn/claim loop mechanics.

## 4. Titus 1:12 Protocol: No Ponzi Selling

- **Core Principle:** Do not sell core assets like BTC and ETH during a market dip.
- **Rationale:** Selling into a downturn realizes losses and violates the principle of holding sound money (BTC) as a store of value. Instead, leverage productive assets (DeFi positions) to generate cashflow.

## 5. Conclusion

The current market dip presents an opportunity to optimize the LTTF's DeFi portfolio for cashflow generation. By harvesting existing rewards, staking yield-bearing assets, and exploring new yield farming opportunities, the foundation can generate income without selling its core holdings. This strategy aligns with the Titus 1:12 protocol and the long-term vision of building a sustainable financial foundation for the NationOS project.
