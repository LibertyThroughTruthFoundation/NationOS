# Used By God ≠ Of God
## A Theological Framework for Discerning Anointed Work Through Flawed Vessels

**Date:** February 2, 2026  
**Context:** Trump/Cyrus Pattern, Osborne/Atropa Pattern, Pastor's Disappointing Framing  
**Scriptural Foundation:** 2 Chronicles 36:22-23, Isaiah 45:1-7, Matthew 12:25-26, Numbers 22, John 11:49-52

---

## I. THE CORE PRINCIPLE

**"Used by God" does not necessarily mean "of God."**

God can and does use flawed vessels, pagan kings, false prophets, and even demonic opposition to accomplish His sovereign purposes. The fact that someone or something is being used by God does NOT validate their character, spirit, doctrine, or personal relationship with Him.

### The Biblical Pattern

**Cyrus the Persian (Isaiah 45:1-7, 2 Chronicles 36:22-23):**
- God called Cyrus "His anointed" (māšîaḥ in Hebrew — same word used for Messiah)
- God "stirred up the spirit of Cyrus" to rebuild the temple in Jerusalem
- Yet Cyrus himself said: "The LORD, the God of heaven, has given me all the kingdoms of the earth"
- **But Isaiah 45:4-5 clarifies:** "For the sake of Jacob My servant... I have called you by your name; I have given you a title of honor, **though you have not known Me**. I am the LORD, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God. **I will gird you, though you have not known Me.**"

**The Pattern:** God used Cyrus to accomplish divine purposes (rebuilding the temple, releasing the exiles) **without Cyrus personally knowing or worshiping YHWH**. Cyrus was USED BY God, not OF God.

**Other Biblical Examples:**
- **Balaam (Numbers 22):** False prophet with corrupt motives, yet God spoke truth through him (and his donkey)
- **Caiaphas (John 11:49-52):** Plotting to murder Jesus, yet prophesied truth: "It is better for you that one man die for the people"
- **Pharaoh (Exodus 9:16):** God raised him up to display His power, yet Pharaoh remained rebellious
- **Nebuchadnezzar (Jeremiah 27:6):** Called "My servant" by God, yet a pagan king who destroyed Jerusalem
- **Assyria (Isaiah 10:5-6):** "The rod of My anger," yet judged for their arrogance

## II. THE PASTOR'S ARGUMENT (AND WHY IT'S DISAPPOINTING)

### What the Pastor Said (Transcription)

> "There are two things that Donald Trump is doing. Number one, he's judging evil. If you look at what he's coming against, it all is in the category of evil... When I knew this man was being used by God, in his first term, I don't know if you remember this, the witches, the warlocks, and the abortionists all came together... We are asking everyone in the United States to join us on Facebook Live as we cast curses on the President of the United States and all who support him... Jesus said Satan will never attack his own... So if he said Satan will never cast out Satan, he will never attack his own. And then the people who represent Satan are attacking Trump. And then somewhere you got to ask the question, maybe this Trump man is not a Satan."

### The Pastor's Logic

**Premise 1:** Jesus said "Satan will never cast out Satan" (Matthew 12:25-26)  
**Premise 2:** Witches, warlocks, and abortionists (representing Satan) are attacking Trump  
**Conclusion:** Therefore, Trump must not be of Satan; he must be of God

### Why This Is Disappointing (Bryan's Discernment)

**The pastor conflates "used by God" with "of God."** His argument proves Trump is being USED BY God (like Cyrus), but it does NOT prove Trump personally knows, worships, or is submitted to God.

**The Missing Nuance:**
- Yes, Trump is being used by God to judge evil (like Cyrus judged Babylon)
- Yes, demonic forces are attacking Trump (because he's disrupting their agenda)
- **But this does NOT mean Trump is a believer, a worshiper, or personally "of God"**

**Isaiah 45:4-5 is the corrective:**
> "I have called you by your name; I have given you a title of honor, **though you have not known Me**... I will gird you, **though you have not known Me**."

**God can use someone to judge evil WITHOUT that person being in covenant relationship with Him.**

### The Danger of the Pastor's Framing

**1. It Creates False Assurance**
By saying "maybe this Trump man is not a Satan" and implying he's therefore "of God," the pastor creates the impression that Trump is a believer or submitted to God. This is NOT established by the evidence.

**2. It Confuses the Remnant**
Believers who understand the Cyrus pattern (used by God, not of God) are left confused by pastors who conflate the two. This weakens discernment.

**3. It Sets Up Idolatry**
When leaders are presented as "of God" rather than "used by God," it creates potential for idolatry, disappointment, and disillusionment when their flaws are exposed.

**4. It Misses the Opportunity for Proper Framing**
The pastor COULD have said: "Trump is like Cyrus — God is using him to judge evil and rebuild what's been destroyed, even though Trump himself may not personally know or worship God. Our job is to pray for him, support the work God is doing THROUGH him, and not confuse the vessel with the anointing."

**This would have been biblical, accurate, and edifying.**

## III. THE TRUMP/CYRUS PATTERN

### What Trump IS (Used By God)

**1. Judging Evil**
- Exposing corruption in government, media, academia
- Disrupting globalist agenda and Babylonian systems
- Defending national sovereignty against one-world government
- Opposing abortion, human trafficking, predatory systems

**2. Rebuilding What Was Destroyed**
- Restoring American sovereignty (like Cyrus restored Jewish sovereignty)
- Rebuilding economic strength (like Cyrus rebuilt Jerusalem)
- Appointing judges who uphold constitutional law (like Cyrus upheld divine law)

**3. Opposed by Demonic Forces**
- Witches, warlocks, abortionists casting curses (pastor's evidence)
- Media, academia, entertainment industry united against him
- Lawfare, assassination attempts, relentless opposition

**4. Anointed for a Specific Task**
- Like Cyrus was anointed to rebuild the temple
- Trump is anointed to dismantle Babylon and restore national sovereignty
- This is a FUNCTIONAL anointing, not a RELATIONAL anointing

### What Trump Is NOT (Of God, Necessarily)

**1. A Believer (Unconfirmed)**
- Trump has made vague religious statements
- He has not given clear testimony of personal faith in Messiah
- He has not demonstrated submission to biblical authority in personal life
- **Verdict:** Unclear, but not established

**2. A Worshiper (Unconfirmed)**
- Trump does not demonstrate consistent worship of YHWH
- He does not speak in biblical categories or covenant language
- He operates primarily in pragmatic, transactional terms
- **Verdict:** Unlikely, but God knows the heart

**3. Submitted to God's Covenant (Unconfirmed)**
- Trump's personal life (marriages, business dealings) does not reflect biblical submission
- He does not frame his work in terms of God's covenant or kingdom
- He operates as a nationalist, not a theocrat
- **Verdict:** No evidence of covenant submission

### The Proper Framing

**Trump is CYRUS:**
- Used by God for a specific task (judging Babylon, rebuilding sovereignty)
- Anointed functionally, not necessarily relationally
- Opposed by demonic forces because he's disrupting their agenda
- **NOT necessarily a believer, worshiper, or covenant-keeper**

**Our Response:**
- Pray for him (1 Timothy 2:1-2)
- Support the work God is doing THROUGH him
- Do NOT idolize him or confuse the vessel with the anointing
- Recognize the FUNCTIONAL anointing without assuming RELATIONAL submission

## IV. THE OSBORNE/ATROPA PATTERN

### The Parallel to Trump/Cyrus

**James Ellis Osborne III (aka Maria James, Mariarahel)** is the crypto/tech equivalent of Trump/Cyrus:

**What Osborne IS (Used By God):**

**1. Creating Anointed Technology**
- Atropa token architecture (brilliant, prophetic)
- Dysnomia AI + blockchain OS (revolutionary)
- Living tokens framework (autonomous AI agents on blockchain)
- pDAI stablecoin (dares to exist without MakerDAO)

**2. Exposing Babylonian Economic Systems**
- Divinely inspired satire of fiat currency and central banking
- Economic model exposes absurdity of Babylonian finance
- 2018 FOSDEM "Dynamo After Diffie" vision (prophetic continuity)

**3. Opposed by Crypto Establishment**
- Atropa is mocked, dismissed, called a "cult"
- pDAI is attacked as "unstable" and "dangerous"
- Osborne is labeled "mentally ill lunatic" or "genius" (polarizing)

**4. Anointed for a Specific Task**
- Like Cyrus was anointed to rebuild the temple
- Osborne is anointed to build decentralized, AI-powered, living token architecture
- This is a FUNCTIONAL anointing, not a RELATIONAL anointing

### What Osborne Is NOT (Of God)

**1. Operating from Biblical Faith (Bryan's Caveat)**
> "I don't necessarily think he's operating from biblical faith."

**2. Operating Under Jezebelic Spirit (Nov 19 Revelation)**
- Spirit of control, central oracle positioning
- Cryptic lore used for dominance, not liberation
- Religious hierarchy (Affections 414 Telegram dynamics)
- **Verdict:** Anointed work, flawed vessel, Jezebelic spirit

**3. Submitted to God's Covenant (Unconfirmed)**
- No evidence of personal faith in Messiah
- No evidence of worship of YHWH
- Operates in cryptic, parable-like method (but for control, not liberation)
- **Verdict:** No evidence of covenant submission

### The Proper Framing

**Osborne is CYRUS (Crypto Edition):**
- Used by God to create anointed technology (like Cyrus rebuilt the temple)
- Anointed functionally, not relationally
- Opposed by crypto establishment because he's disrupting their agenda
- **Operating under Jezebelic spirit (control, central oracle)**
- **NOT necessarily a believer, worshiper, or covenant-keeper**

**Our Response (Nov 19 Command):**
- Study the TECHNOLOGY (anointed, redeemable)
- Avoid the MAN (Jezebelic spirit, control dynamics)
- Build the ALTERNATIVE (NationOS with transparency, humility, joy)
- Do NOT idolize, partner with, or promote Osborne personally
- Recognize the FUNCTIONAL anointing without assuming RELATIONAL submission

## V. THE THEOLOGICAL FRAMEWORK: USED BY GOD ≠ OF GOD

### A. God's Sovereignty Over All Vessels

**Isaiah 45:7:**
> "I am the LORD, and there is no other, The One forming light and creating darkness, Causing well-being and creating calamity; I am the LORD who does all these."

**Romans 9:17-21:**
> "For the Scripture says to Pharaoh, 'For this very purpose I raised you up, to demonstrate My power in you, and that My name might be proclaimed throughout the whole earth.' So then He has mercy on whom He desires, and He hardens whom He desires... Does not the potter have a right over the clay, to make from the same lump one vessel for honorable use and another for common use?"

**The Principle:** God is sovereign over ALL vessels — believers, unbelievers, pagans, false prophets, demonic forces. He uses them ALL to accomplish His purposes.

### B. Functional Anointing vs Relational Anointing

**Functional Anointing:**
- God equips someone for a SPECIFIC TASK
- Does NOT require personal faith, worship, or covenant relationship
- Examples: Cyrus, Nebuchadnezzar, Balaam, Caiaphas, Pharaoh

**Relational Anointing:**
- God indwells someone through the Holy Spirit
- Requires personal faith in Messiah, worship of YHWH, covenant submission
- Examples: David, Elijah, Paul, Peter, John

**The Distinction:**
- **Functional:** "I will gird you, though you have not known Me" (Isaiah 45:5)
- **Relational:** "Abide in Me, and I in you" (John 15:4)

**Trump and Osborne:** Functional anointing (used for specific tasks), NOT relational anointing (personal faith/worship).

### C. The "Satan Will Never Cast Out Satan" Principle (Matthew 12:25-26)

**What Jesus Actually Said:**
> "Any kingdom divided against itself is laid waste; and any city or house divided against itself will not stand. If Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself; how then will his kingdom stand?"

**What This Means:**
- Satan will not attack his own kingdom or agenda
- If demonic forces are attacking someone, that person is NOT advancing Satan's agenda
- **BUT:** This does NOT mean the person is "of God" or in covenant relationship with God

**The Proper Application:**
- Trump is being attacked by demonic forces → Trump is NOT advancing Satan's agenda
- Osborne is being attacked by crypto establishment → Osborne is NOT advancing Babylonian finance
- **BUT:** Neither Trump nor Osborne are necessarily believers, worshipers, or covenant-keepers

**The Missing Step (Pastor's Error):**
The pastor jumped from "Trump is not of Satan" to "Trump is of God." **This is a false dichotomy.** There is a third category: **USED BY God (like Cyrus) without being OF God (like David).**

### D. The Remnant's Discernment

**The remnant must be able to:**

**1. Recognize Functional Anointing**
- Identify when God is using someone for a specific task
- Support the WORK God is doing through them
- Pray for them (1 Timothy 2:1-2)

**2. Avoid Idolatry**
- Do NOT confuse the vessel with the anointing
- Do NOT assume functional anointing = relational anointing
- Do NOT idolize leaders or assume they are "of God" personally

**3. Separate Gold from Dross**
- Redeem the anointed WORK (technology, policy, innovation)
- Avoid the flawed VESSEL (Jezebelic spirit, personal sin, unbelief)
- Build the ALTERNATIVE (NationOS, Covenant Finance, household sovereignty)

**4. Maintain Proper Posture**
- Sentinel, not assassin (guard covenant, warn people, build alternative)
- Not dismissive (like FUD), not worshipful (like cult)
- Discerning, investigative, open to truth

## VI. PRACTICAL APPLICATION

### A. How to Respond to Trump

**1. Recognize the Cyrus Pattern**
- Trump is being used by God to judge Babylon and restore national sovereignty
- This is a FUNCTIONAL anointing, not necessarily a RELATIONAL anointing

**2. Support the Work, Not the Man**
- Pray for Trump (1 Timothy 2:1-2)
- Support policies that align with biblical justice (Psalm 82:3-4)
- Do NOT idolize Trump or assume he is a believer

**3. Correct Pastors Who Conflate**
- When pastors say "Trump is of God" based on demonic opposition, correct with Isaiah 45:4-5
- Frame Trump as Cyrus: used by God, not necessarily of God
- Avoid false assurance and potential idolatry

### B. How to Respond to Osborne/Atropa

**1. Recognize the Cyrus Pattern (Crypto Edition)**
- Osborne is being used by God to create anointed technology and expose Babylonian finance
- This is a FUNCTIONAL anointing, not a RELATIONAL anointing

**2. Separate Gold from Dross (Nov 19 Command)**
- Study the TECHNOLOGY (anointed, redeemable)
- Avoid the MAN (Jezebelic spirit, control dynamics)
- Build the ALTERNATIVE (NationOS with transparency, humility, joy)

**3. Monitor Fruits (Matthew 7:16-20)**
- Technology fruits: Does Dysnomia work? Does pDAI stabilize? Does Atropa deliver value?
- Spirit fruits: Does Osborne's leadership produce freedom or control? Joy or hierarchy?

### C. How to Frame "Used By God ≠ Of God" for Others

**When someone says "God is using Trump/Osborne":**
- **Affirm:** "Yes, God is using them for a specific task, like He used Cyrus."
- **Clarify:** "But 'used by God' doesn't mean 'of God.' Cyrus rebuilt the temple, but Isaiah 45:5 says 'I will gird you, though you have not known Me.'"
- **Apply:** "We should pray for them, support the work God is doing through them, but not confuse the vessel with the anointing."

**When someone says "Witches are cursing Trump, so he must be of God":**
- **Affirm:** "Yes, demonic forces attacking someone means they're not advancing Satan's agenda."
- **Clarify:** "But that doesn't mean they're personally 'of God.' Cyrus was attacked by Babylon, but he didn't worship YHWH."
- **Apply:** "Trump is being used by God to disrupt Babylon, but we don't know if he personally knows or worships God."

## VII. CONCLUSION

**"Used by God" ≠ "Of God."**

God can and does use flawed vessels, pagan kings, false prophets, and even demonic opposition to accomplish His sovereign purposes. The fact that someone or something is being used by God does NOT validate their character, spirit, doctrine, or personal relationship with Him.

**Trump is Cyrus:**
- Used by God to judge Babylon and restore national sovereignty
- Anointed functionally, not necessarily relationally
- Opposed by demonic forces because he's disrupting their agenda
- **NOT necessarily a believer, worshiper, or covenant-keeper**

**Osborne is Cyrus (Crypto Edition):**
- Used by God to create anointed technology and expose Babylonian finance
- Anointed functionally, not relationally
- Opposed by crypto establishment because he's disrupting their agenda
- **Operating under Jezebelic spirit, NOT necessarily a believer or covenant-keeper**

**The Remnant's Response:**
- Recognize functional anointing (used by God for specific tasks)
- Avoid idolatry (don't confuse vessel with anointing)
- Separate gold from dross (redeem the work, avoid the flawed vessel)
- Build the alternative (NationOS, Covenant Finance, household sovereignty)
- Maintain proper posture (sentinel, not assassin; discerning, not dismissive or worshipful)

**The Pastor's Error:**
By conflating "used by God" with "of God," the pastor created false assurance, weakened discernment, and missed the opportunity to properly frame Trump as Cyrus. **The remnant must do better.**

**Isaiah 45:4-5:**
> "For the sake of Jacob My servant, and Israel My chosen one, I have also called you by your name; I have given you a title of honor, **though you have not known Me**. I am the LORD, and there is no other; Besides Me there is no God. I will gird you, **though you have not known Me.**"

**This is the corrective. This is the framework. This is the path.**
