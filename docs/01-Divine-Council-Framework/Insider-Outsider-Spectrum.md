# Insider-Outsider Spectrum: Family & Friends Mišpāṭ

**Document Created:** January 27, 2026  
**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026 (Professing Believer Status Corrected + Matt 18:15-20 Discipline Steps Added)  
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of family/friend relationships using 1 Cor 5:12 insider-outsider framework, remnant filter (Rom 9:27), and professing believer status

---

## Executive Summary

This document applies the **1 Corinthians 5:12 insider-outsider framework** to Bryan Pavlovic's family and friend relationships, integrating **professing believer status**, **biological/shared fate bonds**, and **remnant filter** (Rom 9:27 שְׁאָר - shear) to determine appropriate **mišpāṭ** (judgment/justice) standards.

**Key Theological Distinction:**
- **Insiders (Biological/Shared Fate Bonds):** Mom, Heather (ex-wife), Heather's family, Brandon, Brydon, Braymil (brothers)
- **Outsiders (Sojourners/Friends):** Albert, Chris, Kyle, Bella, Steven, Enrique Lopez, Juan

**Professing Believer Status:**
- **Insiders + Professing:** Mom, Heather, Heather's family → **Matt 18:15-17 church discipline** (progressive confrontation), **Titus 1:13 sharp rebuke** (if Cretan patterns)
- **Insiders + Non-Professing:** Brandon, Brydon, Braymil → **1 Cor 5:12 outsider treatment** (God judges, no church discipline), but **biological bond complicates** (family loyalty vs. gospel witness)
- **Outsiders + Professing:** Albert, Chris, Kyle, Bella → **1 Cor 5:12 insider treatment** (church discipline if sin), but **no biological tension** (fresh gospel walk)
- **Outsiders + Non-Professing:** Steven, Enrique Lopez, Juan → **1 Cor 5:12 outsider treatment** (God judges, gospel invite, Col 4:5-6 wisdom gracious salt)

## Theological Framework

### 1 Corinthians 5:12-13 (Foundation)

**1 Corinthians 5:12 (ESV):**
> "For what have I to do with judging outsiders? Is it not those inside the church whom you are to judge?"

**Greek:**
- **τίς ἐμοὶ κρῖναι τοὺς ἔξω** (tis emoi krinai tous exō): "What to me to judge those outside?" (rhetorical: not my business)
- **οὐχὶ τοὺς ἔνδον κρίνετε** (oukhi tous endon krinete): "Are you not judging those inside?" (command: judge insiders)

**1 Corinthians 5:13 (ESV):**
> "God judges those outside. 'Purge the evil person from among you.'"

**Theological Analysis:**
1. **Judge Insiders:** Christians are **commanded** to judge those **inside the church** (professing believers), applying church discipline (Matt 18:15-17) and expelling the wicked (Deut 13:5)
2. **God Judges Outsiders:** Christians are **not to judge** those **outside the church** (non-professing), as God will judge them (1 Cor 5:13)

---

### Complication: Biological/Shared Fate Bonds

**Definition:**
- **Biological bonds:** Family members (parents, siblings, children)
- **Shared fate bonds:** Ex-spouse (covenant history, children, shared past)

**Complication:** Biological/shared fate bonds create **tension** between:
1. **Family loyalty** (natural affection, shared history, loss/jealousy valence)
2. **Theological framework** (gates-level thinking, remnant filter, Creed Gates compliance)

**Result:** Insiders (biological/shared fate bonds) may resist theological framework due to **loss/jealousy valence** (Titus 1:12 Cretan patterns: slow, lazy, liars), while outsiders (sojourners/friends) may embrace theological framework due to **fresh gospel walk** (no biological tension).

---

### Matthew 18:15-20 (Church Discipline Steps)

**Matthew 18:15-20 (ESV):**
> "If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them."

**Greek:**
- **ἐλέγχω** (elenchō): "Reprove, rebuke, convict" (v. 15: "tell him his fault")
- **δύο ἢ τρεῖς μάρτυρας** (duo ē treis martyras): "Two or three witnesses" (v. 16: Deut 19:15 principle)
- **εἰπὸν τῇ ἐκκλησίᾳ** (eipon tē ekklēsia): "Tell it to the church" (v. 17: public censure)
- **ἔστω σοι ὥσπερ ὁ ἐθνικὸς καὶ ὁ τελώνης** (estō soi hōsper ho ethnikos kai ho telōnēs): "Let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector" (v. 17: excommunication)

**Four-Step Progressive Discipline:**

#### Step 1: Private Reproof (Matt 18:15)

**Action:** "Go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone."

**Purpose:**
- **Restore relationship** ("you have gained your brother")
- **Protect reputation** (private, not public)
- **Gentle confrontation** (Gal 6:1: "restore him in a spirit of gentleness")

**Application:**
- **Insiders + Professing (Mom, Heather, Heather's family):** Private reproof first (Matt 18:15), no public accusation
- **Outsiders + Professing (Albert, Chris, Kyle, Bella):** Private reproof first (Matt 18:15), no public accusation

**Web Reference:** [GraceToday.net: Church Discipline](https://gracetoday.net) (Granular ops: private reproof protocol, restoration focus)

---

#### Step 2: Witnesses (Matt 18:16)

**Action:** "Take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses."

**Purpose:**
- **Establish facts** (Deut 19:15: "A single witness shall not suffice... only on the evidence of two witnesses or of three witnesses shall a charge be established")
- **Accountability** (2 Cor 13:1: "Every charge must be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses")
- **Escalation** (if private reproof fails)

**Application:**
- **Insiders + Professing (Mom, Heather, Heather's family):** If private reproof fails, bring 1-2 witnesses (Matt 18:16)
- **Outsiders + Professing (Albert, Chris, Kyle, Bella):** If private reproof fails, bring 1-2 witnesses (Matt 18:16)

**Web Reference:** [GraceToday Podcast: Church Discipline Steps](https://gracetoday.net/podcast) (Granular ops: witness protocol, Deut 19:15 application)

---

#### Step 3: Church Censure (Matt 18:17a)

**Action:** "If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church."

**Purpose:**
- **Public accountability** (church body aware of sin)
- **Corporate discipline** (church leaders involved)
- **Final warning** (before excommunication)

**Application:**
- **Insiders + Professing (Mom, Heather, Heather's family):** If witnesses fail, tell church (Matt 18:17a)
- **Outsiders + Professing (Albert, Chris, Kyle, Bella):** If witnesses fail, tell church (Matt 18:17a)

**Web Reference:** [GraceToday.net: Church Censure Protocol](https://gracetoday.net) (Granular ops: public accountability, corporate discipline)

---

#### Step 4: Excommunication (Matt 18:17b)

**Action:** "If he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector."

**Purpose:**
- **Purge wicked** (1 Cor 5:13: "Purge the evil person from among you")
- **Protect church** (Titus 3:10: "After warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him")
- **Final judgment** (treat as outsider)

**Application:**
- **Insiders + Professing (Mom, Heather, Heather's family):** If church censure fails, excommunicate (Matt 18:17b, treat as outsider)
- **Outsiders + Professing (Albert, Chris, Kyle, Bella):** If church censure fails, excommunicate (Matt 18:17b, treat as outsider)

**Cross-References:**
- **1 Corinthians 5:13:** "Purge the evil person from among you" (expel wicked from church)
- **Titus 3:10:** "After warning him once and then twice, have nothing more to do with him" (3 strikes: private → witnesses → church → excommunication)
- **Deuteronomy 13:5:** "So you shall purge the evil from your midst" (OT precedent for purging wicked)

**Web Reference:** [GraceToday.net: Excommunication Protocol](https://gracetoday.net) (Granular ops: 3 strikes, treat as outsider)

---

### Remnant Filter (Rom 9:27)

**Romans 9:27 (ESV):**
> "And Isaiah cries out concerning Israel: 'Though the number of the sons of Israel be as the sand of the sea, **only a remnant of them will be saved**.'"

**Hebrew:** שְׁאָר (shear) = remnant, survivors, those who remain

**Application:**
- **Not all insiders saved:** Only a **remnant** (שְׁאָר - shear) of those with biological/covenant ties (insiders) will be saved, not all who profess faith (Matt 7:21-23)
- **Not all professing believers saved:** Only a **remnant** of professing believers will be saved (Matt 7:13-14: "Enter by the narrow gate... those who find it are few")
