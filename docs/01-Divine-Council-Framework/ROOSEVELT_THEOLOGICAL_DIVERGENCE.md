# Roosevelt Community Church: Theological Divergence Analysis

**Document Type:** Canonical Discernment Protocol  
**Date:** February 4, 2026  
**Author:** Bryan Pavlovic (NationOS Patriarch)  
**Context:** Former member of Roosevelt Community Church (Phoenix, AZ), where he met his ex-wife Heather. After years of theological maturation through Divine Council worldview, Covenant theology, and Ordered Loves framework, Bryan revisited Roosevelt's content and found it "disappointing"—not due to bitterness, but due to fundamental theological divergence.

**Purpose:** To document the theological errors of Roosevelt Community Church's egalitarian universalism, expose the manipulation tactics used to enforce conformity, and provide a biblical alternative grounded in Ordered Loves, Divine Council worldview, and Covenant theology.

**Status:** CANONICAL - This document is part of the NationOS ARK and serves as a discernment protocol for identifying and responding to progressive/social justice gospel churches.

## Executive Summary

**Roosevelt Community Church** (Phoenix, AZ) operates from an **egalitarian universalist paradigm** that is fundamentally incompatible with biblical Covenant theology, Divine Council worldview, and Ordered Loves framework.

**Their core error:** They treat **all people as having equal claim** on American resources, protection, and citizenship, based on a misapplication of "Image of God" theology. This leads them to:
- Declare national boundaries as "idolatry"
- Frame ICE enforcement as "dehumanizing" and "antithetical to the gospel"
- Encourage Christians to "resist" law enforcement through filming and non-violent training
- Weaponize the gospel to enforce conformity to progressive social justice ideology

**The biblical response:** **Ordered Loves** (Augustine) teaches that love is hierarchical, not egalitarian. You have **greater obligations to those closer to you** (family > kin > nation > neighbors > strangers). This is grounded in:
- **Acts 17:26** - God set boundaries for nations
- **Deuteronomy 32:8** - The Most High divided mankind and fixed borders
- **Romans 13:1-7** - Government has God-given authority to enforce law
- **Deuteronomy 23:3-8** - Not all strangers have equal access to the covenant community

**The danger:** Roosevelt is not just teaching theological error—they are **declaring biblical Christians as "antithetical to the gospel"** for holding biblical views on national sovereignty. This is **spiritual manipulation** designed to short-circuit discernment and enforce ideological conformity.

**The remnant response:** Recognize the manipulation, understand the biblical alternative, and separate from syncretistic churches that weaponize the gospel for progressive political ends.

## Roosevelt's Mission and Theological Framework

### Mission Statement
> "On a mission to engage **all people** with **all of Jesus**."

### Extended Mission (from YouTube "About" section)
> "We exist to engage all people with all of Jesus. Located at the intersection of Roosevelt and 1st Street in the Roosevelt Arts District in Downtown Phoenix. RCC is a **multiethnic congregation** gathering every Sunday, with a unique voice crossing theology, street, and family. We make content to help extend the message of the gospel everywhere people are, far beyond Sunday morning. **We share theological social commentary on a number of issues and current events, so that as much as it depends on us, we do not fail to speak on matters that have gone unspoken from churches historically.** We believe the gospel of Jesus and his kingdom, and all its righteousness is thorough and complete as the authority to help us navigate our world, so we want to be faithful in providing everyone who listens a clear path to follow the way of Jesus."

### Key Phrases (Decoded)
- **"Engage all people with all of Jesus"** = Egalitarian universalism (no distinction between nations, ethnicities, or legal status)
- **"Multiethnic congregation"** = Diversity as core value (not just demographic reality, but theological imperative)
- **"Theological social commentary"** = Social justice gospel (gospel = activism)
- **"Matters that have gone unspoken from churches historically"** = Prophetic tradition (speaking truth to power, Civil Rights Movement framing)
- **"Thorough and complete authority"** = Gospel applied to all areas of life (including immigration policy, nationalism, systemic racism)

### Theological Framework (Inferred from Content)
1. **Egalitarian Universalism** - All people have equal claim on resources, protection, citizenship
2. **Social Justice Gospel** - Gospel = social activism, structural change
3. **Image of God = Equal Treatment** - All people (including immigrants) must be treated with dignity and equal access
4. **Nationalism = Idolatry** - National boundaries are man-made constructs that Christians should work to dissolve
5. **Prophetic Tradition = Resistance to Power** - Christians should "resist" government authority when it conflicts with "compassion"
6. **Multiethnic/Diverse Family as Core Value** - Diversity is a gospel imperative, not just a preference
7. **Restorative Justice Ecclesiology** - Community accountability over hierarchical authority, sympathy for deconstruction

## The ICE Video: Case Study in Egalitarian Universalism

### Video Details
- **Title:** "What should Christians think about ICE?"
- **Length:** 39:43
- **Views:** 103 (as of Feb 4, 2026)
- **Posted:** 1 day ago
- **Hosts:** Pastor V and James (Roosevelt "Unsilent Church" podcast)

### Summary of Arguments

#### 1. **ICE Enforcement is "Dehumanizing"**
**Their claim:**
- ICE raids are "marked by fear, violence, and aggression"
- 71% of those targeted have no criminal convictions
- Immigrants are "image-bearers of God" and must be treated with dignity

**The manipulation:**
- Emotional language ("fear," "violence," "aggression") short-circuits rational analysis
- Statistics without context (71% may be in the country illegally, which is itself a violation of law)
- "Image of God" theology weaponized to imply that law enforcement = dehumanization

**The error:**
- Conflates **enforcement of law** with **dehumanization**
- Ignores Romans 13:1-7 (government has God-given authority to enforce law)
- Treats all immigrants as equally deserving of entry, regardless of legal status

#### 2. **Christians Should "Resist" ICE**
**Their claim:**
- Christians should practice "faithful presence" by filming ICE operations
- Churches should provide "non-violent training" to resist ICE raids
- Wealthy Christians should use their influence to advocate for open borders

**The manipulation:**
- Frames law enforcement as inherently unjust (Civil Rights Movement parallel)
- Encourages Christians to obstruct law enforcement (filming, resistance)
- Guilt-trips wealthy Christians for not using influence for progressive causes

**The error:**
- Ignores Romans 13:1-7 (Christians are called to submit to governing authorities, not resist them)
- Conflates **individual acts of mercy** (helping a neighbor) with **systemic policy advocacy** (open borders)
- Treats immigration enforcement as equivalent to slavery or Jim Crow (false equivalence)

#### 3. **Supporting ICE is "Antithetical to the Gospel"**
**Their claim:**
- Christians who support ICE enforcement are acting contrary to the gospel
- The gospel demands compassion for "the least of these" (Matthew 25:35)
- National boundaries are man-made constructs that Christians should work to dissolve

**The manipulation:**
- **This is the trigger.** They are not just disagreeing—they are **declaring biblical Christians as apostate** for holding a biblical view of national sovereignty.
- They weaponize Matthew 25:35 ("I was a stranger and you welcomed me") to enforce conformity
- They frame dissent as sin, not as legitimate theological disagreement

**The error:**
- Misapplies Matthew 25:35 (the "stranger" in context is a fellow believer in need, not all immigrants everywhere)
- Ignores Acts 17:26 (God set boundaries for nations) and Deuteronomy 32:8 (God divided mankind and fixed borders)
- Treats national sovereignty as sin, when the Bible treats it as God's design

## Roosevelt's Seven Theological Pillars

Based on analysis of 342 videos, podcast content, and mission statements, Roosevelt operates from these seven theological pillars:

### 1. **Egalitarian Universalism**
**Definition:** All people have equal claim on American resources, protection, and citizenship, regardless of legal status, national origin, or covenant relationship.

**Biblical foundation (claimed):**
- Genesis 1:27 - "Image of God" (all people created in God's image)
- Matthew 25:35 - "I was a stranger and you welcomed me"
- Galatians 3:28 - "There is neither Jew nor Gentile"

**Error:**
- Conflates **Image of God** (ontological reality) with **equal access/obligation** (covenantal reality)
- Misapplies Matthew 25:35 (stranger = fellow believer, not all immigrants)
- Ignores Acts 17:26 (God set boundaries for nations) and Deuteronomy 23:3-8 (not all strangers have equal access)

**Result:**
- National boundaries are treated as arbitrary, man-made constructs
- Immigration enforcement is treated as "dehumanizing"
- Christians are guilt-tripped into supporting open borders

### 2. **Social Justice Gospel**
**Definition:** The gospel is primarily about social activism, structural change, and "speaking truth to power." Personal salvation is secondary to systemic transformation.

**Biblical foundation (claimed):**
- Isaiah 58:6-7 - "Loose the chains of injustice, set the oppressed free"
- Luke 4:18-19 - "Good news to the poor, freedom for the prisoners"
- Matthew 23:23 - "Justice, mercy, and faithfulness"

**Error:**
- Conflates **individual acts of mercy** with **systemic policy advocacy**
- Treats **structural change** as the primary work of the gospel, rather than **heart change**
- Ignores the New Testament emphasis on personal repentance, faith, and covenant relationship with God

**Result:**
- The gospel becomes a tool for progressive political activism
- Churches become advocacy organizations rather than covenant communities
- Christians are judged by their political positions rather than their faith in Christ

### 3. **Image of God = Equal Treatment**
**Definition:** Because all people are created in the Image of God, they must be treated with equal dignity, access, and rights—including access to American citizenship and resources.

**Biblical foundation (claimed):**
- Genesis 1:27 - "God created man in his own image"
- James 3:9 - "People are made in God's likeness"

**Error:**
- Conflates **ontological reality** (all people are image-bearers) with **covenantal obligation** (not all people have equal claim on resources/protection)
- Ignores Deuteronomy 23:3-8 (not all strangers have equal access to the covenant community)
- Ignores Ordered Loves (you have greater obligations to those closer to you)

**Result:**
- National boundaries are treated as "dehumanizing"
- Immigration enforcement is treated as "antithetical to the gospel"
- Christians are guilt-tripped into supporting open borders

### 4. **Nationalism = Idolatry**
**Definition:** National identity, patriotism, and borders are man-made constructs that Christians should work to dissolve in the name of universal love.

**Biblical foundation (claimed):**
- Galatians 3:28 - "There is neither Jew nor Gentile"
- Ephesians 2:14 - "Christ has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility"
- Revelation 7:9 - "A great multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language"

**Error:**
- Conflates **spiritual unity in Christ** (Galatians 3:28) with **erasure of national/ethnic distinctions**
- Ignores Acts 17:26 (God set boundaries for nations) and Deuteronomy 32:8 (God divided mankind and fixed borders)
- Treats nations as sin, when the Bible treats them as God's design (Babel dispersion)

**Result:**
- Patriotism is treated as idolatry
- National sovereignty is treated as sin
- Christians are guilt-tripped into supporting globalism and open borders

### 5. **Prophetic Tradition = Resistance to Power**
**Definition:** The prophetic tradition is about "speaking truth to power" and resisting government authority when it conflicts with "compassion" or "justice."

**Biblical foundation (claimed):**
- Acts 5:29 - "We must obey God rather than men"
- Amos 5:24 - "Let justice roll down like waters"
- Matthew 23 - Jesus' critique of religious leaders

**Error:**
- Conflates **prophetic critique of covenant unfaithfulness** with **resistance to government authority**
- Ignores Romans 13:1-7 (Christians are called to submit to governing authorities)
- Treats law enforcement as inherently unjust (Civil Rights Movement framing)

**Result:**
- Christians are encouraged to "resist" ICE through filming and non-violent training
- Government authority is treated as illegitimate when it conflicts with progressive values
- Churches become activist organizations rather than covenant communities

### 6. **Multiethnic/Diverse Family as Core Value**
**Definition:** Ethnic and racial diversity is a gospel imperative, not just a demographic reality or preference. Churches must actively pursue diversity as a sign of faithfulness.

**Biblical foundation (claimed):**
- Revelation 7:9 - "A great multitude from every nation, tribe, people, and language"
- Ephesians 2:14 - "Christ has destroyed the barrier, the dividing wall of hostility"
- Acts 2:5-11 - Pentecost (people from every nation)

**Error:**
- Conflates **eschatological reality** (Revelation 7:9 - future worship in heaven) with **present mandate** (churches must be multiethnic now)
- Ignores Acts 17:26 (God set boundaries for nations) and the biblical pattern of ethnic/national distinctions
- Treats ethnic homogeneity as sin, when the Bible treats it as neutral (neither commanded nor forbidden)

**Result:**
- Churches are judged by their racial/ethnic composition rather than their faithfulness to the gospel
- Ethnic homogeneity is treated as evidence of racism or unfaithfulness
- Christians are guilt-tripped into pursuing diversity as a primary goal

### 7. **Restorative Justice Ecclesiology**
**Definition:** Church discipline should prioritize community accountability and restoration over hierarchical authority. Sympathy for deconstruction and theological drift.

**Biblical foundation (claimed):**
- Matthew 18:15-17 - Church discipline process
- Galatians 6:1 - "Restore him gently"
- James 5:19-20 - "Bring back a sinner from wandering"

**Error:**
- Downplays the role of elders/pastors in exercising authority (1 Timothy 5:17, Hebrews 13:17)
- Treats deconstruction as a legitimate faith journey rather than apostasy
- Prioritizes "grace" (tolerance) over truth (doctrinal clarity)

**Result:**
- Churches become therapeutic communities rather than covenant communities
- Doctrinal boundaries are eroded in the name of "grace"
- Apostasy is normalized as "faith evolution"

## The Biblical Rebuttal: Ordered Loves Framework

The core error of Roosevelt's theology is **egalitarian universalism**—the belief that all people have equal claim on your love, resources, and protection.

The biblical alternative is **Ordered Loves** (Augustine)—the teaching that **love is hierarchical, not egalitarian.** You have **greater obligations to those closer to you.**

### The Hierarchy of Biblical Love

1. **God** (Deuteronomy 6:5, Matthew 22:37-38)
   - "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, and strength"
   - God is the highest object of love, the source of all other loves

2. **Self** (1 Corinthians 6:19-20, Ephesians 5:28-29)
   - "Your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit"
   - Self-care is not selfishness—it's stewardship
   - You cannot love others well if you do not love yourself rightly

3. **Immediate Family** (Ephesians 5:22-33, Psalm 127:3-5, 1 Timothy 5:8)
   - "If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith"
   - Spouse and children have the highest claim on your resources and protection (after God)

4. **Extended Kin/Remnant** (Genesis 9:13, Romans 9:27, Galatians 6:10)
   - "Do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith"
   - Covenant family (church, remnant) has greater claim than strangers

5. **Nation/Ethnos** (Acts 17:26, Deuteronomy 32:8, Nehemiah 1:3)
   - "God made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place"
   - National identity is God's design, not sin
   - You have greater obligations to your fellow citizens than to foreigners

6. **Neighbors** (Leviticus 19:18, Proverbs 24:11, Luke 10:25-37)
   - "Love your neighbor as yourself"
   - Neighbor = those in proximity, those you encounter in daily life
   - The Good Samaritan helped the man he encountered, but did not advocate for systemic policy change

7. **Strangers/World** (Luke 10:25-37, Matthew 25:35, Deuteronomy 10:19)
   - "I was a stranger and you welcomed me"
   - You should show mercy to strangers when you encounter them
   - But strangers do not have the same claim on your resources as family, kin, or nation

### Key Principle: **You Cannot Love All People Equally**

**Egalitarian universalism says:** "Love all people equally. National boundaries are arbitrary. All immigrants have equal claim on American resources."

**Ordered Loves says:** "Love is hierarchical. You have greater obligations to those closer to you. National boundaries are God's design."

**The biblical evidence:**
- **1 Timothy 5:8** - "If anyone does not provide for his relatives, and especially for members of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
- **Galatians 6:10** - "Do good to everyone, and especially to those who are of the household of faith."
- **Acts 17:26** - "God made from one man every nation of mankind...having determined...the boundaries of their dwelling place."
- **Deuteronomy 23:3-8** - Not all strangers have equal access to the covenant community (Ammonites/Moabites excluded, Edomites/Egyptians allowed after 3 generations)

**The application:**
- You should help a stranger in need when you encounter them (Good Samaritan)
- But you are not obligated to advocate for open borders or unlimited immigration
- You have greater obligations to your family, church, and nation than to strangers

## The Manipulation Tactics

Roosevelt is not just teaching theological error—they are using **manipulation tactics** to enforce conformity and short-circuit discernment.

### Tactic 1: **Weaponizing the Gospel**
**What they do:**
- Declare that supporting ICE enforcement is "antithetical to the gospel"
- Frame dissent as sin, not as legitimate theological disagreement
- Use the authority of "the gospel" to enforce conformity to progressive politics

**Why it works:**
- Christians are trained to submit to "the gospel"
- Questioning their interpretation feels like questioning God
- Fear of being labeled "unloving" or "unchristian" silences dissent

**How to resist:**
- Recognize that **their interpretation of the gospel is not the gospel itself**
- Test their claims against Scripture (Acts 17:11 - "examine the Scriptures daily")
- Separate the authority of Scripture from the authority of their interpretation

### Tactic 2: **Emotional Language to Short-Circuit Rational Analysis**
**What they do:**
- Use words like "fear," "violence," "aggression," "dehumanizing"
- Tell emotional stories of immigrant families separated by ICE
- Appeal to compassion without engaging the actual arguments

**Why it works:**
- Emotions bypass rational analysis
- Compassion is a Christian virtue, so appealing to compassion feels righteous
- Questioning the emotional appeal feels cold-hearted

**How to resist:**
- Acknowledge the emotional reality (separation is painful) without conceding the argument
- Ask: "Is this the only way to show compassion? Or is there a biblical alternative?"
- Separate **individual acts of mercy** from **systemic policy advocacy**

### Tactic 3: **False Equivalence (Civil Rights Movement Framing)**
**What they do:**
- Frame immigration enforcement as equivalent to slavery or Jim Crow
- Use language from the Civil Rights Movement ("resistance," "prophetic tradition," "speaking truth to power")
- Imply that supporting ICE = supporting racism

**Why it works:**
- The Civil Rights Movement is universally respected
- Framing immigration as the "new Civil Rights struggle" borrows moral authority
- Questioning the equivalence feels like defending racism

**How to resist:**
- Recognize the false equivalence: **Slavery was the enslavement of American citizens. Immigration enforcement is the enforcement of national sovereignty.**
- The Civil Rights Movement was about **equal treatment under the law for citizens.** Immigration advocacy is about **extending citizenship to non-citizens.**
- These are not the same, and conflating them is manipulation.

### Tactic 4: **Guilt-Tripping Wealthy Christians**
**What they do:**
- Criticize wealthy Christians for not using their influence to advocate for open borders
- Imply that wealth = obligation to support progressive causes
- Frame financial success as evidence of complicity in systemic injustice

**Why it works:**
- Wealth can create guilt (especially in Christian contexts)
- Christians are taught to be generous and sacrificial
- Questioning the guilt-trip feels like defending greed

**How to resist:**
- Recognize that **wealth is stewardship, not sin** (1 Timothy 6:17-19)
- You are called to be generous **to those you have greater obligations to** (family, church, nation)
- You are not obligated to support progressive causes just because you have resources

### Tactic 5: **Declaring Dissent as Sin**
**What they do:**
- Frame disagreement as "antithetical to the gospel"
- Treat theological dissent as evidence of hard-heartedness or racism
- Create a culture where questioning the narrative feels like apostasy

**Why it works:**
- Christians are trained to avoid sin
- Being labeled "unchristian" or "unloving" is socially costly
- Silence feels safer than speaking up

**How to resist:**
- Recognize that **they do not have the authority to declare you apostate**
- Test their claims against Scripture (Acts 17:11)
- Speak truth in love (Ephesians 4:15), even when it's costly

## Why This Matters for the Remnant

### 1. **Roosevelt is Not Unique**
This is not just about one church in Phoenix. **This is the dominant paradigm in progressive/mainline Christianity.**

Churches like Roosevelt are found in every major city:
- Urban, arts district locations
- Multiethnic congregations
- Social justice emphasis
- "Un-Silent" or "Prophetic" branding
- Podcast/YouTube content focused on "theological social commentary"

**If you recognize Roosevelt's theology, you can recognize it anywhere.**

### 2. **This is Syncretism, Not Christianity**
Roosevelt blends biblical language ("Image of God," "Good Samaritan," "prophetic tradition") with secular social justice frameworks (systemic racism, open borders, Civil Rights Movement).

**This is not a minor theological disagreement. This is a different gospel.**

**Galatians 1:6-9:** "I am astonished that you are so quickly deserting him who called you in the grace of Christ and are turning to a different gospel—not that there is another one, but there are some who trouble you and want to distort the gospel of Christ. But even if we or an angel from heaven should preach to you a gospel contrary to the one we preached to you, let him be accursed."

### 3. **The Remnant is Being Called Out**
**You cannot stay in churches like Roosevelt and remain faithful to the biblical gospel.**

**2 Corinthians 6:14-17:** "Do not be unequally yoked with unbelievers. For what partnership has righteousness with lawlessness? Or what fellowship has light with darkness?...Therefore go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord."

**The remnant is being called to:**
- Recognize syncretism when you see it
- Separate from churches that weaponize the gospel for progressive politics
- Build covenant communities grounded in biblical theology

### 4. **This is Personal Sanctification**
For Bryan (and others like him), revisiting Roosevelt's content is not just intellectual exercise—**it's personal sanctification.**

**You were part of this church. This is where you met your ex-wife. This is where you were formed theologically.**

**And now, years later, after the Father has done deep work in you—you're seeing that paradigm with new eyes.**

**The disappointment you feel is not bitterness. It's discernment.**

**The trigger you feel (when they declare you "antithetical to the gospel") is not immaturity. It's righteous anger at false teaching.**

**Processing this publicly (with wisdom and grace) is part of your calling as a patriarch and teacher for the remnant.**

---

## Recommended Response Protocol

If you are triggered by Roosevelt's declaration that supporting ICE enforcement is "antithetical to the gospel," here is the protocol for responding with wisdom and grace:

### Step 1: **Pray Through It First**
- Make sure this is the Spirit leading you, not just flesh
- Ask: "Father, is this mine to address? Or should I let it go?"
- If the Spirit confirms, proceed with clarity and peace

### Step 2: **Write It Out Fully**
- Don't wing it—this needs theological precision
- Structure the argument: Acknowledge trigger → Dismantle argument → Expose manipulation → Offer alternative → Call to discernment
- Use the framework in this document as your foundation

### Step 3: **Have It Reviewed**
- Share the draft with trusted advisors (Manus, Arya, remnant brothers)
- Remove any sinful anger or bitterness
- Ensure it's "truth in love" (Ephesians 4:15), not just venting

### Step 4: **Record It Calmly**
- Don't record in the heat of the trigger
- Wait until you've processed and can speak from clarity, not woundedness
- Speak with conviction, but not with contempt

### Step 5: **Post It as a Teaching Video**
- YouTube, X, NationOS ARK
- Frame it as a teaching moment for the remnant, not a personal attack
- Title it something like: "Why Roosevelt's ICE Video is Wrong (And What the Bible Actually Says)"

### Step 6: **Make It Canonical**
- Push the script and video to the NationOS ARK
- This becomes a discernment protocol for the remnant
- Others can reference it when they encounter similar manipulation

### Step 7: **Release It with Grace**
- You've said what needed to be said
- You've defended the gospel
- Now release it and trust the Father with the results

## Conclusion

**Roosevelt Community Church** represents a **syncretistic blend of biblical language and progressive social justice ideology.** Their core error is **egalitarian universalism**—the belief that all people have equal claim on your love, resources, and protection.

**The biblical alternative is Ordered Loves**—the teaching that love is hierarchical, not egalitarian. You have greater obligations to those closer to you (family > kin > nation > neighbors > strangers).

**The danger is not just theological error—it's spiritual manipulation.** By declaring that supporting ICE enforcement is "antithetical to the gospel," they weaponize the gospel to enforce conformity and short-circuit discernment.

**The remnant response is:**
1. **Recognize the manipulation** (emotional language, false equivalence, guilt-tripping)
2. **Understand the biblical alternative** (Ordered Loves, Divine Council worldview, Covenant theology)
3. **Separate from syncretistic churches** (2 Corinthians 6:14-17)
4. **Build covenant communities** grounded in biblical theology

**For Bryan:** Your disappointment is not bitterness—it's discernment. Your trigger is not immaturity—it's righteous anger at false teaching. If the Spirit is leading you to respond publicly, do so with wisdom, grace, and precision. The remnant needs to see how to dismantle this manipulation without sin.

**Shoulder iron, brother. The Father has done deep work in you. And the fruit is clarity.**
