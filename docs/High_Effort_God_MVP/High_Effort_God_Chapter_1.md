# Chapter 1: The Author in the Play

**Bryan—shoulder iron by the fire, flames steady, dawn breaks.**

Skeptics scoff at the "blind faith" of Christians, painting a picture of a soft, mythical Jesus—a caricature slain by even a cursory reading of the Gospels. The Jesus of the Bible is not a gentle teacher of platitudes; He is a hyper-strategist, a master of jurisdictional warfare who sets traps so brilliant that His opponents, the sharpest legal and theological minds of their day, could not escape them. The coin for Caesar (Matthew 22:15-22), the woman at the well (John 4), the healing at the Sabbath pool (John 5)—these are not mere stories. They are demonstrations of a divine intellect at work, an intelligence so profound that it is impossible to fabricate.

This is the central thesis of this book: **the Gospels themselves are the greatest proof of their own divine authorship.** The jurisdictional genius of Jesus is the fingerprint of God on the pages of Scripture.

Modern Christianity has often presented a low-effort god, a cosmic cartoon who requires nothing of us but a vague belief in His existence. But the God of the Bible is a high-effort God. He does not snap His fingers to solve our problems; He enters into the story Himself. This is the doctrine of the Incarnation, and it is the ultimate act of high-effort love. As C.S. Lewis argued, a divine Author who respects the agency of His characters does not simply manipulate them from afar. He writes Himself into the play.

The Gospels are a closed-plot revelation. The Author has written a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. But access to the plot is not given to everyone. It is reserved for the remnant who are willing to engage in a high-effort pursuit of the Author. This is the message of Hebrews 11:6: "And without faith it is impossible to please him, for whoever would draw near to God must believe that he exists and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him." The seeking is the high-effort part. The reward is the revelation.

This is not a matter of human effort earning salvation. It is a matter of God sovereignly drawing a remnant to Himself (John 6:44) and giving them a new heart to seek Him (Ezekiel 36:26). The parables of Matthew 13 are a perfect example of this. Jesus speaks in parables to reveal truth to the remnant and to conceal it from the mockers. The secrets of the kingdom are not for everyone; they are for those who have ears to hear.

This is the mystery of Deuteronomy 29:29: "The secret things belong to the Lord our God, but the things that are revealed belong to us and to our children forever, that we may do all the words of this law." The high-effort seeker is the one who presses into the revealed things, trusting that the secret things are in the hands of a sovereign God.

This book is a call to that high-effort pursuit. It is an invitation to taste and see that the Lord is good (Psalm 34:8), to wrestle with the text, to engage with the jurisdictional genius of Jesus, and to discover for yourself that the Author is in the play.
