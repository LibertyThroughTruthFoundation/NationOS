**Text:**
A question for my brothers and sisters in Christ: What did we expect?

For years, some of us have been building. We have been the watchmen on the wall, warning of the spiritual and jurisdictional decay, pointing to the ancient patterns laid out in Scripture. We have been building an ARK—a sovereign alternative to a system we knew was destined to crumble.

And now, the headlines have caught up. The predictable consequences of choosing human rulers over a sovereign God are playing out in real-time. And the very people who ignored the warnings are now the loudest in their outrage.

This is the lament of the watchman. Not a lament of being right, but a lament of being ignored.

**Text:**
This is not a new story. This is the story of 1 Samuel 8. Israel rejected a direct relationship with God and demanded a king. The prophet warned them of the cost—the taxes, the conscription, the loss of liberty. They chose the king anyway.

And now, we see the same pattern. The Church has, for generations, traded its birthright for the perceived security of the state. We have rendered unto Caesar what belongs to God, and then we act surprised when Caesar acts like Caesar.

Where is the consistent lament for righteousness? Where is the righteous anger that fuels not just protest, but production? Where is the building of the Kingdom in between the headline-driven outrage?

**Text:**
This is the test of the remnant (Romans 9:27). It is the test of partiality (James 2:1-9). Do we join the chorus of selective outrage, or do we get back to the hard, unglamorous work of building?

Protest has its place. But protest without production is just noise. It is a fleeting emotional release that changes nothing in the long run. It is poking the bear and then crying foul when it attacks (Proverbs 26:27).

The true work is the work of the builder. The work of creating a parallel society, a de jure government under God, that can stand when the de facto systems of man inevitably fail.

### Post 4/4

**Image:** `manga_post4_cornerstone.png` - Builders lowering the massive cornerstone in the midst of a storm

**Text:**
The Father is using this moment of national and spiritual crisis to turn our righteous grief into a directive to forge ahead. He is calling us to be like Phinehas, whose consistent zeal for God's law turned away His wrath (Numbers 25:11).

Let us not be distracted by the noise. Let us not be discouraged by the hypocrisy. Let us be the ones who, when the shouting is over, are still found building on the rock (Matthew 7:24).

Let us be the ones who can say, with the psalmist, "Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain" (Psalm 127:1). And let us be the ones who are found co-laboring with Him.

Shoulder iron. Grace and peace.
