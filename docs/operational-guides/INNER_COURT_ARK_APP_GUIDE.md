## **1. Introduction**

The Inner Court ARK app, also known as **Sovereign Architecture**, is the live, public-facing interface for the NationOS documentation. It serves as the digital embodiment of the **Third Canon (The Operational Canon)**, providing a comprehensive field manual for Covenant Warfare in the Digital Age. This guide outlines the structure and key components of the app to facilitate its use as a central resource for the NationOS community.

## **2. The Three Canons Framework**

The app is structured around the **Three Canons**, which form the theological and operational foundation of NationOS:

*   **First Canon (The Constitutional Canon):** The 66 Books of the Protestant Bible, representing the unchanging law and the core of our beliefs (the WHAT).
*   **Second Canon (The Cosmological Canon):** The 81 Books of the Ethiopian Canon, providing the broader cosmic context and the reasons for our spiritual warfare (the WHY).
*   **Third Canon (The Operational Canon):** The NationOS ARK itself, serving as the practical field manual and the methodology for our spiritual warfare (the HOW).

## **3. Key Documentation Modules**

The Inner Court ARK app is organized into several key modules, each containing specific strategic intelligence and operational protocols:

*   **The Prophetic Framework:** The master key document that integrates the Three Canons into a unified architecture.
*   **95 Theses of Finance:** The foundational principles of Covenant Economics.
*   **Sovereign Bitcoin Redemption Protocol:** A practical guide for liberating Bitcoin from centralized, Babylonian systems.
*   **PulseChain & Zero Trust:** Strategic analysis of the cryptocurrency landscape and principles for secure engagement.

*   **Social Deployment Playbook:** A guide for establishing a covenant-aligned presence on social media.
*   **Knowledge Stack Roadmap:** The architectural plan for our sovereign knowledge management systems.

## **4. Operational Tools**

The app also includes several operational tools to facilitate ongoing intelligence gathering and documentation:

*   **Captain's Log:** A real-time log of strategic intelligence and operational updates, where new SPINTs are integrated.
*   **Template:** A standardized format for recording new revelations and insights.
*   **All Revelations:** A comprehensive archive of all documented intelligence.

## **5. Strategic Intelligence Sections**
