# Master Taproot: Foundational Aggregation (v2 - Corrected)
## Date: February 23, 2026

## I. INTRODUCTION: THE CANONICAL SPINE
This document is the **Master Taproot**—the single canonical reference spine for the entire NationOS ecosystem. It serves as the definitive inventory of all foundational documents, frameworks, and theological pillars. Its purpose is to provide a centralized, organized, and perpetually updated reference for content creation, internal education, and strategic development.

This is a living document. As new frameworks are codified and existing ones are refined, this Taproot will be updated to reflect the current state of the ARK.

| 3 | **Five Immutable Creeds** | Complete | `docs/01-Divine-Council-Framework/NATIONOS_FIVE_IMMUTABLE_CREEDS.md` |

| 6 | **Cyrus Test Framework** | Skill | `/skills/cyrus-test/SKILL.md` |
| 7 | **PHIAT Framework (v1 + v2)** | Complete | `docs/04-Cosmic-Gospel/` |
| 8 | **95 Theses of Covenant Finance** | Complete | `95-theses-covenant-finance/` (repo) |
| 9 | **Covenant Economics / Finance** | Distributed | Drive: `COVENANT_FINANCE_MANIFESTO`, `CoFi_Architecture`, HEG research, Gab AI exports |
| 10 | **NationOS 12 Pillars** | Complete | `docs/12_PILLARS_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`, Drive: `sovereign_way_12_pillars_extracted.md` |
| 11 | **AI Stewards / CAP Framework** | Complete | `docs/COVENANT_AGENT_PROTOCOL/CAP_v1.0.md`, `docs/Documentation_v1.0.0/ai-stewards/` |

| 15 | **Sovereign Emojis** | Complete | `docs/03-Sovereign-Stack/NationOS-Brand-Assets-Sovereign-Emojis.md` |

### B. What is Genuinely Missing or Needs Creation (The 4 Gaps)

| Priority | Document Needed | Proposed Location | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | **RAG Framework (Standalone)** | `/protocols/RAG-Framework.md` | **Missing.** The term "RAG" appears only once in a non-technical context. This needs to be created from scratch to define the AI steward retrieval process. |
| 2 | **Ordered Loves (Standalone Expansion)** | `/docs/02-Household-OS-Specs/Ordered-Loves.md` | **Exists as Creed 3.** A standalone expansion with visuals would be beneficial but is not a critical gap. |
| 3 | **Household OS Core (Unified Index)** | `/docs/02-Household-OS-Specs/Household-OS-Core.md` | **Exists as 13+ files.** A master index document is needed to unify the distributed files into a coherent whole. |
| 4 | **Cyrus Test (NationOS Document)** | `/docs/03-Sovereign-Stack/Cyrus-Test.md` | **Exists as a Manus skill.** Needs to be exported and committed as a canonical NationOS document. |
