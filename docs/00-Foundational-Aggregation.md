**Version:** 3.0 (Definitive Audit)
**Date:** February 23, 2026
**Author:** The Sovereign Sentinel + Manus (Scribe)
**Classification:** TLP: GREEN — Covenant Access
**Purpose:** The canonical spine from which all content creation, education, and infrastructure flows.

## Preamble

This document is the **taproot** — the single primary root from which all secondary roots, branches, and fruit derive their nourishment. It is not a table of contents. It is a **living index** of every foundational framework, doctrine, protocol, and creative asset in the NationOS ecosystem. It serves three functions: **(1)** a reference spine for habitual content creation, **(2)** an internalization map for the Sovereign Sentinel's own formation, and **(3)** a gap tracker that ensures nothing essential is left unbuilt.

The ecosystem spans **381+ markdown documents** across 6 GitHub repositories and Google Drive, representing eleven years of building. This index organizes them into **30 canonical frameworks** grouped under 7 domains.

## Closing

> **Psalm 1:3** — "He is like a tree planted by streams of water, which yields its fruit in season, and whose leaf does not wither. Whatever he does prospers."

The taproot is planted. The streams are identified. The fruit will come in season.

**Jude 3. Contend. Forge. The ARK is eternal.**
