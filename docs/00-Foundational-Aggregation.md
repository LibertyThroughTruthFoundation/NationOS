## 1. Purpose: The Taproot

This document serves as the **Master Taproot** for the entire NationOS ecosystem. It is the single, canonical reference spine from which all content, education, and infrastructure flows. Its purpose is to:

*   **Aggregate:** Provide a comprehensive inventory of all foundational frameworks.
*   **Discern:** Clearly map what exists versus what needs to be created.
*   **Organize:** Structure our core theology, philosophy, and operational strategy into a coherent whole.
*   **Habituate:** Create a rotating lexicon and content calendar to build a rhythm of creation, internalization, and education.
*   **Seed:** Serve as the foundational source material for long-form works, including the **High Effort God (HEG) Trilogy** and the **NationOS Parallel System** documentation.

## 2. Master Framework Inventory

This table provides a complete audit of our foundational documents, categorized into four primary domains.

| Category | Framework | Status | Canonical Location(s) | Notes / Gaps | Book Tie |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Theological** | Multi-Canon Approach | **EXISTS** | `docs/04-Cosmic-Gospel/` | Ethiopian 81-book list is the priority lens. | HEG Vol 1 |
| | Divine Council | **EXISTS** | `docs/theology/Nephilim-BeneElohim-Comprehensive-Guide-2026-02-20.md` | Comprehensive guide exists. Forms the basis of our cosmic worldview. | HEG Vol 1 |
| | High Effort God (HEG) | **PARTIAL** | `docs/High_Effort_God_MVP/` & `docs/05-Bezalel-Market/` | Multiple outlines and scripts exist. Needs consolidation into a single canonical outline. | HEG Trilogy |
| | Five Immutable Creeds | **NEEDS CREATION** | — | Partially defined in `docs/LOGO_CREED_AUDIT.md` but requires a standalone, robust document. | NationOS Pillars |
| | Ordered Loves | **NEEDS CREATION** | — | Concept exists in notes but no canonical document has been created. | Household OS |
| | 95 Theses | **EXISTS** | `docs/strategic-frameworks/95_THESES_OF_COVENANT_FINANCE.md` | Theses for Covenant Finance exist. Could be expanded to cover all of NationOS. | HEG Vol 1 |
| **Economical** | PHIAT Frameworks | **PARTIAL** | `docs/04-Cosmic-Gospel/` (Theological) & `docs/03-Sovereign-Stack/` (Brand Assets) | Theological depth is strong. The practical "jars" application needs a dedicated document. | HEG Vol 3 |
| | Covenant Economics | **EXISTS** | `docs/strategic-frameworks/` & Google Drive | Multiple files exist. Needs consolidation into a single "Covenant Economics Complete Reference" in GitHub. | HEG Vol 3 |
| | NationOS 12 Pillars | **PARTIAL** | `docs/12_PILLARS_PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md` | Product roadmap exists, but the core definition of each pillar needs a standalone document. | NationOS Core |
| **Operational** | Household OS | **PARTIAL** | `docs/02-Household-OS-Specs/` | Multiple specific documents exist, but a `Household-OS-Core.md` is needed. | NationOS Pillars |
| | RAG Framework | **NEEDS CREATION** | — | Concept and implementation are active, but no formal framework document exists. | AI Stewards |
| | AI Stewards (Trinity) | **EXISTS** | `docs/COVENANT_AGENT_PROTOCOL/CAP_v1.0.md` & Google Drive | `TRINITY_OPERATIONAL_FRAMEWORK` in Drive is canonical. CAP v1.0 is the agent-specific implementation. | NationOS Core |
| | Cyrus Test | **NEEDS CREATION** | `/skills/cyrus-test/` | The skill exists, but the theological and operational framework needs a standalone document. | Sovereign Stack |
| **Cosmological** | Cosmology Architecture | **PARTIAL** | `docs/theology/Nephilim-BeneElohim-Comprehensive-Guide-2026-02-20.md` | Nephilim/ET guide is strong. A standalone `FLAT_EARTH_CANONICAL_AUDIT.md` is needed. | HEG Vol 1 |

## 4. Rotating Lexicon & Content Rhythm

This section provides the structure for a habitual rhythm of content creation and internalization.

### Rotating Lexicon Table (Structure)

This table will be populated and serve as a quick-reference for creating content.

| Concept | Frameworks | Scripture Anchor(s) | Canonical Doc | HEG/NationOS Tie |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Dominion Subdue | PHIAT (Property), NationOS (Pillar 1) | Gen 1:28, Ps 8:6 | `P.H.I.A.T.-Theological-Depths.md` | HEG Vol 3 (HOW) |
| Bene Elohim | Divine Council, Cosmology | Deut 32:8 (LXX), Ps 82:8, Enoch 6 | `Nephilim-BeneElohim-Comprehensive-Guide.md` | HEG Vol 1 (WHY) |
| Kin-First Provision | Ordered Loves, PHIAT (Income) | 1 Tim 5:8, Eph 5:25 | `Ordered-Loves.md` (To Be Created) | Household OS |
| Jubilee Reset | Covenant Economics | Lev 25:8-55, Deut 15:6 | `jubilee-tokenomics-architecture.md` | NationOS Core |

### Content Calendar Rhythm (Proposed)

A weekly cycle to build consistency and depth.

*   **Monday:** **PHIAT Pillar Post.** Deep dive into one of the five pillars (Property, Health, Income, Assets, Time) on a rotating basis. (Target: X/Gab)
*   **Wednesday:** **Divine Council Probe.** A post exploring a specific aspect of the Divine Council, cosmology, or spiritual warfare. (Target: X/Gab)
*   **Friday:** **HEG Draft Day.** Focused writing session to draft or refine a section of the High Effort God trilogy, using the lexicon as a guide.
*   **Sunday:** **Sovereign Sentinel.** A weekly summary or devotional for the inner court, tying the week's themes together.

This Master Taproot is a living document. It will be updated as new frameworks are created and existing ones are refined. It is the heart of our ARK, the engine of our content, and the map for our mission. our our Kingdom journey toward which we build. Amen live and from which all things flow.
