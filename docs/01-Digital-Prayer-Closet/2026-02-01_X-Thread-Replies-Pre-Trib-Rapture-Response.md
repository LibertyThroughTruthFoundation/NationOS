Excellent defense of Pre-Trib Rapture by @PaulsCorner. We align on rightly dividing the Word (2 Tim 2:15) & the blessed hope producing comfort, not fear (1 Thess 4:18). But the hard Church/Israel binary misses the remnant ecclesiology (Rom 11:5) & Divine Council worldview (Deut 32:8-9 LXX/DSS). #IronSharpensIron

**Tweet 2/3:**

We challenge the Pre-Trib timing w/ the Post-Trib gathering of the elect (Matt 24:29-31). The Church endures tribulation (refining fire, Mal 3:2-3, 1 Pet 1:7) but is delivered from God's wrath (1 Thess 1:10, 5:9). The gathering is post-trib, pre-wrath. #NationOS #DivineCouncil

This isn't a critique of the method, but an invitation to expand the canon (MT/LXX-DSS/Ethiopian/Cosmic Gospel). The Church isn't replacing Israel; it's grafted into the olive tree (faithful remnant + believing Gentiles). Full analysis here: [LINK TO GITHUB/BLOG POST]

Brother @PaulsCorner, thank you for your detailed defense of the Pre-Trib Rapture. Your passion for the blessed hope is evident. As you say, "Iron sharpens iron" (Prov 27:17). Here's a response from the NationOS / Divine Council framework. (Thread)

**Tweet 2/N:**

**ALIGNMENT:** We agree on so much. Rightly dividing the Word (2 Tim 2:15), the importance of comfort over fear (1 Thess 4:18), the distinction between Church & Israel's programs, the "in Christ" mystery, & God's pattern of delivering His people from wrath (2 Pet 2:9). ✅

**CHALLENGE 1: Hard Church/Israel Binary vs. Remnant Ecclesiology.**

You rightly say Church ≠ Israel. But they aren't mutually exclusive. Paul, an Israelite, was in the Church (Rom 11:1). The Church includes the faithful remnant of Israel + believing Gentiles grafted in (Rom 11:17-24).

**CHALLENGE 2: The Divine Council Worldview.**

Your framework is solid within the Masoretic Text (MT). But the LXX/DSS of Deut 32:8-9 reveals the Divine Council worldview. The 70 nations were allotted to the "sons of God," while YHWH's portion is Jacob. The mystery of the Church (Eph 3:6) is the grafting of the nations back into God's family through Christ.

**CHALLENGE 3: Pre-Trib Timing vs. Post-Trib Gathering.**

You place the rapture before the Tribulation. But Matthew 24:29-31 is explicit: "Immediately *after* the tribulation of those days... he shall send his angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather together his elect."

**Tweet 6/N:**

To make Pre-Trib work, the "elect" in Matt 24 must be redefined as "Israel only." But the text says "His elect" (Jesus' elect). This seems like eisegesis (reading a system into the text) rather than exegesis (drawing meaning from the text).

**CHALLENGE 4: Escapism vs. Refining Fire.**

We affirm deliverance from *wrath* (1 Thess 1:10, 5:9). But we also affirm endurance through *tribulation* (John 16:33, Acts 14:22). The purpose of tribulation is refining fire (Mal 3:2-3, 1 Pet 1:7). Rev 3:10 ("keep thee from") can mean "protection through," not just "removal before."

**Tweet 8/N:**

**OUR POSITION: Post-Trib, Pre-Wrath.**

1. The Church endures the tribulation (persecution, refining fire).
2. The gathering/rapture (Matt 24:29-31, 1 Thess 4:16-17) occurs *after* the tribulation.
3. The Church is then delivered from God's eschatological *wrath*, which is poured out on the rebellious world (Rev 6:16-17).

**Tweet 9/N:**

This isn't a critique of your heart or your love for the Word, brother. It's an invitation to a broader canonical discussion (MT, LXX, DSS, etc.) that reveals a more integrated, though still distinct, relationship between Israel and the Church. #IronSharpensIron #NationOS
