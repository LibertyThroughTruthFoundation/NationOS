**A Case Study for the Remnant: Framework Collision & Logical Absurdity**

A recent exchange on the Pre-Trib Rapture revealed a critical lesson in discernment. When a theological system requires you to reject the plain words of Jesus, the system is the problem, not the text.

Let's dissect the logical collapse.

**The Core Absurdity: "Matthew 24 Isn't for the Church"**

The argument: Jesus spoke to "Jews under the Law" before the Church existed, so Matt 24 is for Israel only.

The problem: By this logic, we must also reject:
- The Great Commission (Matt 28)
- The Lord's Supper (Matt 26)
- "I will build my church" (Matt 16)

All were spoken *before* Pentecost. If Matt 24 is disqualified, so is the foundation of the Church's mission and practice. The system is inconsistent.

**The "Jewish Question" Fallacy**

The argument: The disciples asked about the temple (a "Jewish question"), so the answer is only for Israel.

The problem: They asked THREE questions (Matt 24:3):
1. When will the temple be destroyed?
2. What is the sign of Your coming?
3. What is the sign of the end of the age?

Jesus answered all three in one discourse. The system *imposes* audience switches where Jesus makes none.

**The "Pauline Mystery" Misused**

The argument: Paul's "mystery" (Eph 3) creates a new eschatology for the Church, separate from Jesus' words.

The problem: The mystery is *WHO* is in the Church (Gentiles as fellow heirs with believing Israel), not *WHAT* the Church experiences.

Paul's revelation doesn't erase Jesus' eschatology; it expands *who* participates in it.

**The Danger of "Kingdom Context"**

The argument: The Sermon on the Mount, Lord's Prayer, and Matt 24 are all "Kingdom context," not for the Church.

This is the most dangerous claim. It implies:
- "Love your enemies" is not for the Church.
- "Our Father which art in heaven" is not for the Church.
- "Seek ye first the kingdom of God" is not for the Church.

If the Sermon on the Mount isn't for the Church, the Church has no ethics.

**Eisegesis vs. Exegesis**

The argument: "We're not rejecting Jesus' words, just putting them where God put them."

The problem: God put them in Jesus' mouth, speaking to His disciples, who became the foundation of the Church.

The system *moves* them to a different audience to protect itself. That's eisegesis (reading into the text), not exegesis (reading from the text).

**The Inescapable Conclusion**

The entire Pre-Trib system that rejects Matthew 24 rests on a premise that, if applied consistently, would force us to discard the Great Commission, the Lord's Supper, and the Sermon on the Mount.

When a system requires such logical gymnastics, it has elevated itself above the Word of God.

**A Word to the Remnant**

Let Scripture interpret Scripture. Do not let a man-made system force you to carve up the words of Jesus and assign them to different audiences He never specified.

The Word is a seamless garment. The systems of men are full of holes.
