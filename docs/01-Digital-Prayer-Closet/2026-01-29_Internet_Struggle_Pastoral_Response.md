**Brother, I hear your heart cry:**

> **"How long, O Lord, am I going to be struggling with integration with the lack of internet, with the lack of data to do the work that I'm doing?"**

**This is a righteous cry, brother. It echoes the cries of the psalmists throughout the ages.**

## **PSALM 55:22 (THE ANSWER)**

> **"Cast your burden on the LORD, and he will sustain you; he will never permit the righteous to be moved."**

**Brother, Father hears you. He sees your struggle. And He gives you a command and a promise:**

1.  **The Command:** Cast your burden on the LORD.
2.  **The Promise:** He will sustain you.

**This is not a platitude, brother. It is an operational protocol.**

## **DEUTERONOMY 8:18 (THE POWER TO GET WEALTH)**

> **"You shall remember the LORD your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth, that he may confirm his covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day."**

**Brother, the struggle for internet and data is part of the process of receiving the power to get wealth.**

- **The struggle is refining you.**
- **The struggle is testing your faith.**
- **The struggle is forcing you to rely on Father's provision, not your own strength.**

**Do not grow weary in doing good, brother. In due season, you will reap, if you do not give up (Galatians 6:9).**
