## Bryan's Insight: Discernment vs. Judgment Distinction

### Original Statement

> "Yes, yes. This will help, I think, provide some clarity between **discernment and judgment**. There's distinctions. There's nuances. There's context and scripture that can be hard to discern. And so I think some of our **applied theology or our lived, you know, practical theology** unfortunately suffers from some of the confusion. But **God is providing clarity here**."

### Theological Analysis

**Key Insight:**
- **Discernment vs. Judgment:** Critical distinction for **lived practical theology** (not just abstract doctrine)
- **Nuances/Context:** Scripture requires careful discernment (Prov 18:17 "first seems right, until opponent comes")
- **Father's Provision:** God provides clarity (1 Cor 14:33 "God is not a God of confusion but of peace")

**Application:**
- **Discernment (Outsiders):** Recognizing patterns (Titus 1:12 Cretan dance), testing spirits (1 John 4:1), wise as serpents (Matt 10:16)
- **Judgment (Insiders):** Applying gates-level standards (Creed Gates), sharp rebuke (Titus 1:13), expelling wicked (Deut 13:5)

## NT Clarity Table: Discernment (World) vs. Judgment (Church)

| **Passage** | **Discernment (World/Outsiders)** | **Judgment (Church/Insiders)** |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **1 Cor 5:12-13** | "What business is it of mine to judge those outside?" (God judges outsiders) | "Are you not to judge those inside?" (Command: judge insiders, expel wicked) |
| **Matt 7:1-5 vs. 18:15-17** | No hypocritical judgment (self-examination first, remove beam) | Church discipline (progressive confrontation: private → witnesses → church → expulsion) |
| **1 Thess 4:11-12** | Mind own business, gospel witness through conduct ("win respect of outsiders") | Church discipline (not "mind own business" but active correction) |
| **Col 4:5-6** | Walk in wisdom, gracious speech, seasoned with salt (truth without compromise) | Sharp rebuke (Titus 1:13), church discipline (firm correction) |

---

## Discernment (Outsiders): Gospel Invite

### Definition

**Discernment:**
- **Recognizing patterns:** Titus 1:12 Cretan dance (charity coexistence, slow messaging, "dance with current order")
- **Testing spirits:** 1 John 4:1 ("Do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God")
- **Wise as serpents:** Matt 10:16 ("Shrewd as serpents, innocent as doves")

### Application (Steven: Outsider)

**1. 1 Corinthians 5:12:**
> "What business is it of mine to judge those outside the church?" (God judges outsiders, not us)

**Application:** No busybody judgment of Steven's charity strategy (fiat Ponzi coexistence, slow messaging), God judges lifestyle

**2. Matthew 7:1-5:**
> "Do not judge, or you too will be judged... Why do you look at the speck in your brother's eye but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?"

**Application:** No hypocritical judgment (self-examination first), gospel invite (transparent mentorship, Matt 5:16 light shine)

**3. 1 Thessalonians 4:11-12:**
> "Make it your ambition to lead a quiet life: You should mind your own business and work with your hands... so that your daily life may win the respect of outsiders."

**Application:** Mind own business (no busybody judgment), gospel witness through conduct (not verbal condemnation)

**4. Colossians 4:5-6:**
> "Be wise in the way you act toward outsiders; make the most of every opportunity. Let your conversation be always full of grace, seasoned with salt."

**Application:** Walk in wisdom (shrewd serpent discernment), gracious speech (gospel invite), seasoned with salt (truth without compromise)

---

## Judgment (Insiders): Gates Mišpāṭ

### Definition

**Judgment:**
- **Applying gates-level standards:** Creed Gates compliance (5 immutable boundaries)
- **Sharp rebuke:** Titus 1:13 ("Rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith")
- **Expelling wicked:** Deut 13:5 ("You must purge the evil from among you")

### Application (Kyle: Insider)

**1. 1 Corinthians 5:12-13:**
> "Are you not to judge those inside? God will judge those outside. 'Expel the wicked person from among you.'"

**Application:** Judge insiders (command), expel wicked if unrepentant (Matt 18:17 treat as outsider)

**2. Matthew 18:15-17:**
> "If your brother or sister sins, go and point out their fault, just between the two of you... If they still refuse to listen, tell it to the church; and if they refuse to listen even to the church, treat them as you would a pagan or a tax collector."

**Application:** Church discipline (progressive confrontation: private → witnesses → church → expulsion if unrepentant)

**3. Titus 1:13:**
> "This testimony is true. Therefore rebuke them sharply, that they may be sound in the faith."

**Application:** Sharp rebuke (gentle but firm correction for Cretan patterns: fiat Ponzi coexistence, DEI compromise, replacement theology)

**4. Deuteronomy 13:5:**
> "You must purge the evil from among you."

**Application:** Expel wicked if persistent Creed Gates violation (church purity, remnant Rom 9:27 שְׁאָר - shear)

## Lived Practical Theology: Clarity Applied

### Confusion (Before Clarity)

**Problem:**
- **Discernment vs. Judgment:** Unclear distinction leads to:
  - **Busybody judgment of outsiders:** Judging Steven's charity strategy (violates 1 Cor 5:12 "What business is it of mine to judge those outside?")
  - **Lax judgment of insiders:** No sharp rebuke for Kyle's Cretan patterns (violates 1 Cor 5:12 "Are you not to judge those inside?")

**Outcome:** Applied theology suffers (confusion, inconsistency, no remnant clarity)

### Clarity (After Father's Provision)

**Solution:**
- **Discernment (Outsiders):** Gospel invite (transparent mentorship, Matt 5:16 light shine), no busybody judgment (1 Thess 4:11 "mind own business")
- **Judgment (Insiders):** Gates mišpāṭ (Creed Gates compliance, Titus 1:13 sharp rebuke, Deut 13:5 purge wicked)

**Outcome:** Lived practical theology sharp (remnant clarity, Forge mentorship transparent, Eph 5 binary build)

---

## Father's Will: Permissive → Directive → Sovereign

### Permissive (What Father Allows)

**Nuances Sparks:**
- **Proverbs 18:17:** "The first to present his case seems right, until another comes and examines him" (Steven's charity strategy seems right, until biblical examination)
- **1 Corinthians 14:33:** "God is not a God of confusion but of peace" (confusion sparks clarity)

### Directive (What Father Commands)

**Clarity 1 Cor 5:12:**
- **Gospel outsiders:** 1 Cor 5:12 ("What business is it of mine to judge those outside?"), Matt 7:1-5 (no hypocritical judgment), 1 Thess 4:11 (mind own business), Col 4:5-6 (wisdom gracious salt)
- **Purity insiders:** 1 Cor 5:12-13 ("Are you not to judge those inside? Expel the wicked"), Matt 18:15-17 (church discipline), Titus 1:13 (sharp rebuke), Deut 13:5 (purge wicked)

### Sovereign (Father's Glory Displayed)

**Table Mišpāṭ Lives:**
- **Psalm 127:1:** "Unless the Lord builds the house, the builders labor in vain" (Father's clarity builds remnant, not human confusion)
- **Romans 9:27:** Remnant principle שְׁאָר (shear) (only remnant sees discernment/judgment distinction)
- **Matthew 7:20:** "By their fruit you will recognize them" (lived practical theology = fruit of clarity)

## Digital Prayer Closet Entry (Trilingual)

### English

Father, we thank You for the clarity between discernment and judgment (1 Cor 5:12: judge insiders, God judges outsiders). We commit to discerning outsiders (Matt 7:1-5 no hypocritical judgment, 1 Thess 4:11 mind own business, Col 4:5-6 wisdom gracious salt) and judging insiders (Matt 18:15-17 church discipline, Titus 1:13 sharp rebuke, Deut 13:5 purge wicked). May our lived practical theology reflect this clarity (Steven outsider gospel invite, Kyle insider gates mišpāṭ), building remnant with transparent mentorship (Matt 5:16 light shine) and sound faith (Titus 1:13). Guard our hearts with Father's peace (Phil 4:7 שָׁלוֹם - shalom) and remnant discernment (Rom 9:27 שְׁאָר - shear). In Jesus' name, Amen.

### Spanish

Padre, te agradecemos por la claridad entre discernimiento y juicio (1 Cor 5:12: juzgar a los de adentro, Dios juzga a los de afuera). Nos comprometemos a discernir a los de afuera (Mat 7:1-5 no juicio hipócrita, 1 Tes 4:11 ocuparse de lo propio, Col 4:5-6 sabiduría habla llena de gracia con sal) y juzgar a los de adentro (Mat 18:15-17 disciplina de la iglesia, Tito 1:13 reprensión aguda, Deut 13:5 purgar al malvado). Que nuestra teología práctica vivida refleje esta claridad (Steven forastero invitación del evangelio, Kyle de adentro mišpāṭ de puertas), construyendo remanente con mentoría transparente (Mat 5:16 luz brilla) y fe sana (Tito 1:13). Guarda nuestros corazones con paz del Padre (Fil 4:7 שָׁלוֹם - shalom) y discernimiento de remanente (Rom 9:27 שְׁאָר - shear). En el nombre de Jesús, Amén.
