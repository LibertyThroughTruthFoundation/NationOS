## 2. PRICING STRATEGY

Based on research into nonfiction theology ebook pricing, here is the recommended strategy:

### **Recommended Price: $9.99**

**Why $9.99?**
- **Nonfiction Sweet Spot:** Research shows that full-length nonfiction ebooks typically price between $5.99 and $9.99 [1]
- **Value Signal:** $9.99 signals that this is a substantial, high-value work (not a quick guide)
- **Comparable Theology Books:** Professional theology ebooks from publishers like Eerdmans and Banner of Truth range from $8-$30 [2] [3]
- **70% Royalty:** On Gumroad, you keep 90% of the sale price (minus payment processing fees), so $9.99 nets you approximately $8.90 per sale

### **Alternative Pricing Options:**

| Price Point | Strategy | When to Use |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **$7.99** | Lower barrier to entry | If you want to maximize volume for a new author launch |
| **$9.99** | Standard nonfiction pricing | Recommended for MVP launch (signals quality) |
| **$12.99** | Premium pricing | After Volume 1 has proven sales and reviews |
| **Pay What You Want (min $7.99)** | Experimental | To test price sensitivity and build goodwill |

**Recommendation:** Start with **$9.99 fixed price** for the MVP launch. After gathering feedback and refining to the "100% version," consider raising to $12.99 for the second edition.

## 3. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION TEMPLATE

Your Gumroad product page is your "silent salesperson." Here is a proven template for the description:

---

### **[PRODUCT PAGE COPY - READY TO USE]**

**Headline:**  
**Tired of the "Soft Jesus" Caricature? Discover the High-Effort God Who Demands—and Rewards—High-Effort Faith.**

**Subheadline:**  
*A systematic theology for the remnant: Jurisdictional warfare, multi-canon witness, and the cosmic legal battle you're already in.*

---

**What if everything you've been taught about faith is two-dimensional?**

Modern Christianity has given us a passive, sentimental Jesus—a cosmic therapist who asks nothing and offers cheap grace. But the God of Scripture is a **High-Effort God**, a master strategist in a cosmic war, and He demands that we engage with the same intensity.

**In Volume 1 of the High-Effort Trilogy, you will discover:**

✅ **Jesus as Hyper-Strategist:** Deconstruct the Coin Trap (Matthew 22), the Sabbath Healing (John 5), and the Woman at the Well (John 4) to see the legal genius behind every move.

✅ **The Multi-Canon Witness:** Integrate insights from the Septuagint, Dead Sea Scrolls, and the Ethiopian Canon (1 Enoch, Jubilees) to understand the Divine Council and the true nature of the spiritual war.

✅ **Jurisdictional Theology:** Learn why there is no neutral ground, and how every action, thought, and word has cosmic legal weight.

✅ **The Remnant's Call:** Understand why parables conceal truth from skeptics and reveal it to seekers—and why you're part of the wheat, not the tares.

---

**This book is NOT for:**
- Those seeking a feel-good devotional
- Readers who want their theology pre-chewed and easy
- Anyone satisfied with the status quo of modern Christianity

**This book IS for:**
- Intellectually curious Christians starving for substance
- Spiritual warriors ready to shoulder the iron
- Truth-seekers who know something is missing in mainstream theology
- Fans of Jordan Peterson, Dr. Michael Heiser, and Chase Hughes who want a biblical framework for the cosmic battle

---

**What You'll Get:**

📖 **200+ pages** of rigorous, biblically-grounded theology  
🔥 **16 chapters** breaking down the "Why" of high-effort faith  
⚔️ **Practical frameworks** for jurisdictional warfare  
📚 **Multi-canon scholarship** (Septuagint, DSS, Ethiopian Canon)  
💪 **A call to action** that will change how you read Scripture forever

---

**About the Author:**

Bryan (Uncle Sovereign Heart) is a theologian, writer, and spiritual warrior committed to reclaiming lost biblical truth for the remnant. This is Volume 1 of a three-volume systematic theology designed to equip believers for the cosmic legal battle we are in.

## 4. EMAIL CAPTURE STRATEGY

Building an email list is critical for launching Volume 2 and creating a sustainable author platform.

### **Strategy 1: Gumroad Email Collection (Built-In)**
- Gumroad automatically captures the email of every customer
- After purchase, customers can opt-in to receive updates from you
- Use this list to announce Volume 2, offer discounts, and share exclusive content

### **Strategy 2: Lead Magnet (Free Sample)**
- Offer the first 2-3 chapters as a **free PDF download** in exchange for an email address
- Use a tool like **ConvertKit** or **Mailchimp** (free tiers available) to manage your list
- Link to this free sample from your social media, blog posts, and community forums

### **Strategy 3: Post-Purchase Email Sequence**
After someone buys Volume 1, send them a 3-email sequence:

1. **Email 1 (Immediate):** Thank you + download link + invitation to join the email list for Volume 2 updates
2. **Email 2 (3 days later):** "What did you think of Chapter 4?" + request for feedback/review
3. **Email 3 (7 days later):** "The story behind Volume 2" + exclusive sneak peek + pre-order offer
