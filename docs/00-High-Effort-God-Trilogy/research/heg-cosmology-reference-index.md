## Core Theological Concepts

### **Cosmology**
- **Tags:** #cosmology #firmament #raqia #dome #creation #heavens #earth
- **Key Passages:** Genesis 1:6-8, Job 37:18, Isaiah 40:22, Psalm 104:5
- **Core Idea:** The biblical model of a geocentric, enclosed world with a solid firmament (raqia) separating the waters above from the waters below. This is the physical stage for the cosmic drama.
- **See Also:** [[Divine Council]], [[Fallen Angels]]

### **Divine Council**
- **Tags:** #divine_council #bene_elohim #sons_of_god #elohim #psalm_82 #cosmic_governance
- **Key Passages:** Psalm 82, Deuteronomy 32:8-9 (LXX/DSS), Job 1:6, 1 Kings 22:19-23
- **Core Idea:** The heavenly assembly of created divine beings (bene elohim) to whom God delegated jurisdictional authority over the nations. Yahweh presides over this council and holds its members accountable.
- **See Also:** [[Fallen Angels]], [[Jurisdictional Theology]]

### **Fallen Angels / Watchers**
- **Tags:** #fallen_angels #watchers #bene_elohim #genesis_6 #enoch #jubilees #rebellion #azazel #semjaza
- **Key Passages:** Genesis 6:1-4, 1 Enoch 6-10, Jubilees 5, 2 Peter 2:4, Jude 6
- **Core Idea:** The rebellion of a specific group of the bene elohim (the Watchers) who abandoned their heavenly station, descended to earth, and corrupted humanity through illicit sexual unions and the teaching of forbidden knowledge.
- **See Also:** [[Nephilim]], [[Demons]], [[Forbidden Knowledge]]

### **Nephilim**
- **Tags:** #nephilim #giants #gibborim #hybrid #anakim #rephaim #post_flood_giants
- **Key Passages:** Genesis 6:4, Numbers 13:33, Deuteronomy 2:10-11, Deuteronomy 3:11, 1 Enoch 7
- **Core Idea:** The hybrid offspring of the fallen Watchers and human women. They were giants of immense power and corruption whose presence on earth necessitated the Great Flood. Remnant bloodlines persisted after the flood.
- **See Also:** [[Fallen Angels]], [[Demons]], [[The Flood]]

### **Demons**
- **Tags:** #demons #unclean_spirits #disembodied_spirits #possession #exorcism
- **Key Passages:** Matthew 12:43-45, Mark 5:1-20, 1 Enoch 15:8-12
- **Core Idea:** The disembodied spirits of the deceased Nephilim. Being of a hybrid nature, they have no place in the spiritual or physical realm and are thus driven to seek embodiment in human or animal hosts.
- **See Also:** [[Nephilim]], [[Spiritual Warfare]]

### **Jurisdictional Theology**
- **Tags:** #jurisdiction #authority #cosmic_warfare #principalities_and_powers #high_effort_intelligence
- **Key Passages:** Ephesians 6:12, Daniel 10, Matthew 22:15-22, Colossians 2:15
- **Core Idea:** The understanding that the conflict between God and the forces of darkness is a legal and jurisdictional one, fought over the rightful authority of nations and individuals. Jesus' ministry is seen as a direct reclamation of this authority.
- **See Also:** [[Divine Council]], [[Spiritual Warfare]]

### **The Great Deception / ET Psyop**
- **Tags:** #deception #psyop #et_narrative #aliens #ufos #reptilians #greys #end_times
- **Key Passages:** 2 Thessalonians 2:9-11, Revelation 13:13-14
- **Core Idea:** The modern narrative of extraterrestrial visitation is the final evolution of the ancient deception. "Aliens" are a modern mask for the fallen bene elohim and their demonic offspring, designed to prepare the world for a final, powerful delusion.
- **See Also:** [[Fallen Angels]], [[Demons]], [[Spiritual Warfare]]

### **Multi-Canon Theology**
- **Tags:** #canon #ethiopian_canon #lxx #dss #enoch #jubilees #sinodos
- **Core Idea:** The prioritization of the fuller 81-book Ethiopian Orthodox canon, supported by the Septuagint (LXX) and Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS), as a more complete and reliable witness to the cosmic gospel than the truncated Masoretic Text (MT).
- **See Also:** [[Fallen Angels]], [[Divine Council]]


### **The Nachash / Serpent Seed**
- **Tags:** #nachash #serpent #satan #serpent_seed #genesis_3 #protoevangelium #cherub
- **Key Passages:** Genesis 3:1-15, Ezekiel 28:13-17, Isaiah 14:12-15, Revelation 12:9
- **Core Idea:** Satan as the shining serpent (nachash), the anointed cherub who fell through pride, and the originator of the seed war (Genesis 3:15) — the cosmic conflict between the seed of the woman and the seed of the serpent.
- **See Also:** [[Fallen Angels]], [[Leviathan]]

### **Leviathan / Chaos Monster**

- **Key Passages:** Job 41, Psalm 74:13-14, Isaiah 27:1, Revelation 12:3, Revelation 13:1-2
- **Core Idea:** The multi-headed serpentine chaos monster of Scripture, representing the ultimate expression of the nachash's power. The dragon of Revelation and the beast from the sea are its eschatological manifestations.
- **See Also:** [[The Nachash]], [[The Great Deception]]

### **Spiritual Warfare**
- **Tags:** #spiritual_warfare #armor_of_god #ephesians_6 #discernment #testing_spirits
- **Key Passages:** Ephesians 6:10-18, 1 John 4:1-3, 2 Corinthians 10:3-5, James 4:7
- **Core Idea:** The believer's active engagement in the cosmic conflict through prayer, discernment, and the full armor of God. The battle is against spiritual forces, not flesh and blood.
- **See Also:** [[Jurisdictional Theology]], [[Demons]]

### **The Flood / Cherem**
- **Tags:** #flood #judgment #noah #cherem #ban #purging #genesis_7
- **Key Passages:** Genesis 6:5-8, Genesis 7:21-23, 1 Enoch 10, 2 Peter 2:5
- **Core Idea:** The Great Flood as divine judgment against the Nephilim corruption, and the subsequent Canaanite conquest as a continuation of the same purging mandate (cherem/ban) against post-flood giant remnants.
- **See Also:** [[Nephilim]], [[Fallen Angels]]

### **Forbidden Knowledge**
- **Tags:** #forbidden_knowledge #azazel #metallurgy #sorcery #enchantments #technology
- **Key Passages:** 1 Enoch 7-8, Genesis 4:22 (Tubal-Cain)
- **Core Idea:** The illicit transfer of heavenly knowledge by the Watchers to humanity, including warfare (metallurgy), sorcery, enchantments, astrology, and cosmetics. This corrupted knowledge accelerated human violence and moral decay.
- **See Also:** [[Fallen Angels]], [[Nephilim]]

### **Mastema and the 10% Plea**
- **Tags:** #mastema #jubilees_10 #demons #permission #testing #satan
- **Key Passages:** Jubilees 10:8-9
- **Core Idea:** After the Flood, the angel Mastema petitioned God to allow 10% of the Nephilim spirits to remain on earth to test and tempt humanity, while 90% were bound. This explains the persistence of demonic activity in the post-flood world.
- **See Also:** [[Demons]], [[Spiritual Warfare]]

### **Sinodos Patterns**
- **Tags:** #sinodos #ethiopian_canon #church_order #cosmic_pastoral #arcs
- **Key Passages:** Sinodos Canons 1-20, 25, 68, 85-100, 92
- **Core Idea:** The Ethiopian Sinodos provides "arcs" (patterns) showing how the divine council's governance flows to earth through the church. Hierarchical stewardship, eschatological judgment, and worship/redemption patterns all connect to the cosmic gospel.
- **See Also:** [[Multi-Canon Theology]], [[Divine Council]]

### **High Effort Intelligence**
- **Tags:** #high_effort #jesus_intelligence #jurisdictional_traps #apologetics #cs_lewis
- **Key Passages:** Matthew 22:15-22, Mark 3:1-6, Matthew 21:23-27, John 6:53-66
- **Core Idea:** Jesus demonstrated "high-effort intelligence" — visible, logical, jurisdictional genius that the audience can follow and verify. This proves the Gospels record a real, hyper-intelligent person, not a fictional deity.
- **See Also:** [[Jurisdictional Theology]]

### **Remnant Theology**
- **Tags:** #remnant #narrow_road #wheat_tares #natural_selection #parousia
- **Key Passages:** Romans 9:27, Matthew 7:14, Matthew 13:24-30, Revelation 1:7
- **Core Idea:** The faithful remnant — the small group of high-effort seekers drawn by the Father — who maintain covenant faithfulness amid the great deception and await the Parousia.
- **See Also:** [[Spiritual Warfare]], [[Jurisdictional Theology]]
