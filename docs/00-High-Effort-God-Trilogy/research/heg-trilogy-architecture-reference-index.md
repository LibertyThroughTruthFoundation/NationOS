## Core Architectural Concepts

### **Trilogy Structure (WHY, WHAT, HOW)**
- **Tags:** #trilogy_architecture #book_structure #why_what_how
- **Core Idea:** The three-volume structure of the High Effort God series, moving from the foundational WHY (Authority of Scripture) to the operational WHAT (Dynamics of Covenant) and the practical HOW (Application in Community).
- **Backlinks:** [[High-Effort God]], [[Jurisdictional-Legal Framework]]

### **High-Effort God (Unifying Principle)**
- **Tags:** #high_effort_god #unifying_principle #jurisdictional_theology #remnant
- **Core Idea:** The central concept of a God who requires deep intellectual and spiritual engagement, standing in contrast to low-effort, sentimentalist theology.
- **Backlinks:** [[Trilogy Structure]], [[Jurisdictional-Legal Framework]]

### **Jurisdictional-Legal Framework (Unifying Principle)**
- **Tags:** #jurisdictional_legal #covenant #cosmic_war #legal_framework
- **Core Idea:** The understanding of the Bible as a legal document and the cosmic conflict as a legal battle over jurisdiction and authority.
- **Backlinks:** [[Trilogy Structure]], [[High-Effort God]]

### **Chassis/Content Distinction**
- **Tags:** #chassis_content #architecture #flexibility #canon
- **Core Idea:** The architectural principle of a rigid, unchanging chassis (the core framework) that can accommodate flexible, evolving content (new research and revelation, e.g., from the Ethiopian canon).

### **Volume 1: WHY (Authority)**

### **Volume 2: WHAT (Covenant)**
- **Tags:** #volume_2 #covenant #economics #salvation #abrahamic_covenant #new_covenant
- **Core Idea:** The second volume's focus on unpacking the dynamics of covenant as the central organizing principle of Scripture, from salvation to economics.
