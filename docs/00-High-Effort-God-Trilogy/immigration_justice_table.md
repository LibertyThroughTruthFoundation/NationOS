# Immigration Justice: Therapeutic vs. Covenantal Frameworks

| Aspect | Therapeutic Social Justice | Covenantal Biblical Mishpat |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Immigration** | Views immigrants through the lens of an oppressor/oppressed narrative ("neighbors of color" as victims). Frames law enforcement (ICE) as inherently brutal and unjust ("kidnapping"). Aligns with DEI and anti-White narratives. | Views immigration through the lens of national sovereignty and covenantal boundaries. Upholds the right of a nation to guard its gates (Deuteronomy 23:3-8) and protect its ethnos (Acts 17:26) from replacement. Sees lawful enforcement as a righteous act. |
| **Solution** | Political protest and activism. Demands that Caesar (the government) solve the problem through policy changes. Aligns with liberation theology (MLK). | Repentance and the building of a parallel, covenantal society (NationOS). Focuses on household and community sovereignty as the foundation for national restoration. |
| **Fruit** | Outrage, division, anxiety, and a perpetual sense of crisis. | Order, dominion, peace, and the fruitfulness of a people living in alignment with God's law (Psalm 127, Psalm 91). |
| **Root Cause** | Sees the problem as systemic racism and political oppression. Focuses on symptoms. | Sees the problem as a spiritual war (Ephesians 6:12) against principalities and powers that have breached the nation's covenantal gates. Focuses on the root spiritual cause. |
