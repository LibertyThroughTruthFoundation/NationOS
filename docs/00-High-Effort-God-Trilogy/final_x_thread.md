A cousin shared a prayer for husbands from a popular Christian book. I love his heart and our covenant bond. But the prayer itself reveals the core weakness of therapeutic Christianity.

It quotes Psalm 51, but strips it of its power. It misses the foundational principle: mercy trumps justice. David says God desires a "broken heart," not sacrifice (v. 17). This is about covenant alignment, not ritual performance.

The therapeutic model also misses the multi-layered nature of David's prayer. It was a king's legal appeal that cascaded from:

- Personal sin
- To national consequences
- To a plea for covenantal restoration so he could rebuild Zion's walls (v. 18)

It wasn't a therapy session; it was jurisdictional warfare.

David's plea, "Do not take Your Holy Spirit from me" (v. 11), is not a fear of losing salvation. It's a king's desperate cry to retain his functional capacity to govern.

Without the Spirit, he loses fellowship, discernment, and authority. He becomes useless to God's plan on earth.

Therapeutic Christianity sanitizes this into a private emotional struggle. Covenant Christianity recognizes it as a plea for operational readiness.

For years, I prayed Psalm 51 from a therapeutic mindset. But the High-Effort God calls us from the shallow waters of emotional management to the deep waters of covenantal warfare.

My journey is the bridge. Are you ready to cross it?
