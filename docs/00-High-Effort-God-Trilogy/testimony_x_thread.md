# X Thread: From Therapeutic to Covenant Prayer

---

### **Tweet 1/3**

A cousin shared a prayer from a popular Christian book. I love his heart and our covenant bond. But the prayer itself reveals a huge problem in modern Christianity.

It quotes Psalm 51 ("create in me a clean heart") as a plea for better feelings. But that strips the verse of its power. David wasn't in therapy; he was a king who had breached his covenant with God and compromised his nation. His prayer was a legal appeal to restore his authority so he could rebuild Zion's walls (v. 18).

Therapeutic Christianity turns warriors into patients.

The therapeutic model prays away anger. The covenant model asks, "Is this a righteous signal of a jurisdictional breach?" (Ephesians 4:26)

The therapeutic model asks for passive understanding. The covenant model calls husbands to be vigilant gatekeepers who gather tactical intelligence to guard their homes (1 Peter 3:7, 1 Timothy 3:4-5).

Therapeutic prayer is about managing your emotions. Covenant prayer is about managing your jurisdiction.

For years, I prayed Psalm 51 from a purely therapeutic mindset. I was stuck in the shallow water, asking God to make me feel better.

But the High-Effort God calls us deeper. He calls us out of the therapy room and onto the battlefield.

My journey from therapeutic to covenant prayer is the bridge I want to build for the remnant. Are you ready to cross it?
