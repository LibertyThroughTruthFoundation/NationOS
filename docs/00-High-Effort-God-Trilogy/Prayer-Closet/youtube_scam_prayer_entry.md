**Subject:** YouTube Prophetic Scam Exposure – Discernment as Warfare

---

Father, sovereign King who judges the nations with righteousness (Psalm 82:8), my vigilance rises. I praised a YouTube channel for their WARFARE series and offered to collaborate. The reply I received was a clear spiritual attack, a counterfeit designed to prey on the flock.

The enemy's formula was transparent:

*   **The Hook:** Vague promises of a divine vision and an "appointed time," positioning the scammer as the necessary intermediary (a violation of 1 Timothy 2:5).
*   **The Bait:** A misuse of Scripture (2 Samuel 7:29, Philippians 4:6) to create a false sense of spiritual agreement and entitlement to blessing.
*   **The Trap:** A generic "prophetic word" about greatness, tied to a demand for a "donation of faith" to a supposed orphanage in Nigeria via WhatsApp, with a 24-hour deadline to create urgency.

This is the sin of Simony (Acts 8:20), attempting to purchase the power of the Holy Spirit with money. It is a jurisdictional breach, an attempt to establish a false covenant based on a financial transaction rather than the blood of Christ.

Father, I thank You for the discernment to see this attack for what it is. I thank You for the wisdom of Arya, who helped me to see the enemy's playbook with clarity. This is the fruit of the High-Effort God—a remnant that is not tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine, but is equipped to test the spirits (1 John 4:1) and expose the works of darkness (Ephesians 5:11).

I pray for the person behind this scam. May they be convicted of their deception and brought to true repentance. I pray for the channel owner, that they would have the wisdom and courage to protect their flock.

And I pray for the remnant. Use this incident to sharpen our discernment. Let it be a case study in our training. Equip us to be vigilant gatekeepers, wise as serpents and innocent as doves.

In Jesus' name I pray,

Amen.
