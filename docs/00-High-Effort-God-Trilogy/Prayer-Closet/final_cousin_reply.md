Brother,

This is covenant fire right here. Thank you. I am praying for your Nehemiah goals: the persistent prayer for family, the physical discipline, and the intentional walk with Lori through that book. I am with you in all of it.

That prayer you shared has been sparking a lot of thought for me. Psalm 51 has been hitting me deep lately—especially the part where David says God desires a broken heart over sacrifice (v. 17), showing that mercy trumps justice in God's economy. And the layers of it—from his personal sin to the national consequences and the restoration of Zion's walls (v. 18).

For years, I prayed that psalm from a purely therapeutic, feelings-based perspective. But lately, I've been seeing it as a king's legal appeal to restore his covenant status.

It's been a real wrestle. The book you're reading—does it get into any of that? The idea of anger as a signal, or the husband as a gatekeeper with tactical understanding? I'd be curious to hear.

Grace and peace, brother. Praying for your trip.
