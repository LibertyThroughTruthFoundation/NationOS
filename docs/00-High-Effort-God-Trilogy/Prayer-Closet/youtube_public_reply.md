@After-All-t4y-z1m Thanks for the reply, but discernment flags this as a classic prophetic manipulation scam. True prayer doesn't require a financial transaction as a condition for breakthrough (Acts 8:20, the sin of Simony).

1 Timothy 2:5 makes it clear that Christ is the only Mediator. There is no need for a WhatsApp contact at a Nigerian orphanage to secure a "faith donation" for a miracle.

To the rest of the family here, please test the spirits (1 John 4:1). The 24-hour urgency, the promise of financial breakthrough tied to a donation, and the redirection to a private messaging app are all major red flags.

To the channel owners, I love your content. Please consider moderating your comments to protect the flock from these kinds of predatory tactics.

To the person behind this account, I pray for your repentance. Blessings.
