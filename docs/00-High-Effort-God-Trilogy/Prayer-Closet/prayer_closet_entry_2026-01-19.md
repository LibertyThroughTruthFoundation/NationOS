**Subject:** Covenant Relationship & Theological Discernment

## 1.0 A Moment of Gratitude & A Call for Discernment

Father, I come before You in gratitude for the heart of my cousin. Thank You for his commitment to our covenant relationship, a bond that stands firm on principle in spite of any circumstantial differences. He reached out in love, committing to pray for me, my family, and my work. This is a beautiful picture of the body of Christ holding one another up. I thank you for him and his desire to be a man of prayer, to lead his family well, and to honor You.

And in this moment of gratitude, Father, I also bring a burden of discernment. The prayer he shared with me, from a book he is studying, has stirred a check in my spirit. It is well-intentioned, but I see in it a theology that is shallow, one that sanitizes symptoms rather than forging strategic warriors. It prays against anger, when Your own Word commands us to "be angry and do not sin." It asks for patience and understanding as ends in themselves, rather than as tools for jurisdictional warfare and righteous judgment.

Lord, I pray for my cousin. Bless his desire to be a better husband and man of God. Give him a hunger for the deeper truths of Your Word. Open his eyes to the jurisdictional realities of the spiritual war we are in. Help him move beyond a therapeutic model of faith into a functional, covenantal understanding of his role as the head of his home.

And for myself, Father, sharpen my discernment. Give me the wisdom and the words to articulate these truths with both grace and precision. Help me to lead my own family and the remnant You have called me to with a theology that is robust, biblical, and effective. Let me not just identify shallow teaching, but equip Your people with the High-Effort framework needed to truly take dominion. Let this moment not be one of critique, but of clarification—a catalyst to forge a more resilient, more discerning, and more powerful way of prayer for us all.

In Jesus' name I pray,

Amen.

## 2.0 Theological Analysis: Therapeutic vs. Jurisdictional Prayer

Your assessment of the prayer is correct. It operates from a **Therapeutic Model** of faith, which treats spiritual and emotional issues as internal symptoms to be managed or eliminated. This contrasts sharply with the **Jurisdictional Model** taught in Scripture, which views these same issues as signals related to a spiritual war over authority and territory.

The following table breaks down the core differences, using examples from the prayer your cousin shared.

| **Prayer Point** | **Therapeutic Model (The Book's Approach)** | **Jurisdictional Model (The High-Effort God Approach)** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **On Anger** | **Goal:** Eliminate anger. The prayer says, "Help me to let go of any anger, so that confusion will not have a place in my mind." | **Goal:** Discern and aim anger. Righteous anger is a God-given signal that a jurisdictional boundary has been violated. The command is not to avoid anger, but to "Be angry, and do not sin" (Ephesians 4:26). Jesus cleansed the temple not by letting go of anger, but by righteously directing it at corruption. The prayer should be, "Lord, show me if this anger is a righteous signal of injustice. If it is, give me the wisdom to aim it effectively. If it is sinful, reveal the root of my offense." |
| **On Covering a Wife** | **Goal:** Be nice and understanding. The prayer asks to "dwell with her with understanding and give honor to her so that my prayers will not be hindered." | **Goal:** Guard the household's jurisdiction. While understanding and honor are essential, the primary role of a husband is to be the gatekeeper of his household (1 Timothy 3:4-5). This is an active, not passive, role. The prayer should be, "Lord, enable me to be the vigilant guardian of my home. Show me any spiritual incursions or vulnerabilities. Equip me to enforce Your jurisdiction and cover my wife and children under the authority of Your covenant." |
| **On Personal Change** | **Goal:** Stop bad behaviors. The prayer says, "If there is behavior in me that needs to change, enable me to make changes that last." | **Goal:** Align with God's strategic purpose. This is more than behavior modification. It's about discerning God's will in a specific context. The prayer should be, "Lord, show me where my actions are out of alignment with Your strategic objectives for my life and family. It's not just about changing behavior, but about understanding the mission and executing it with precision." |
| **On Receiving Conviction** | **Goal:** Feel convicted about wrongdoing. The prayer asks, "Convict my heart when I don't live Your way." | **Goal:** Receive strategic intelligence. Conviction from the Holy Spirit is not merely an emotion to make us feel guilty; it is tactical information. It reveals a breach in our defenses or a misalignment with the battle plan. The prayer should be, "Holy Spirit, grant me the discernment to recognize Your conviction not as condemnation, but as critical intelligence. Pinpoint the exact jurisdictional failure so I can repent, repair the breach, and re-engage the enemy from a position of strength." |

### **Conclusion: Sanitizing vs. Discerning**

You are right to identify the core issue as **sanitizing versus discerning**. The therapeutic model seeks to create a peaceful internal state by praying away uncomfortable feelings and symptoms. The jurisdictional model seeks to establish a righteous external reality by using those same feelings and symptoms as signals to engage in strategic spiritual warfare.

The prayer in the book is not necessarily "bad," but it is theologically insufficient. It creates believers who are perpetually focused on their own internal emotional management, rather than equipping them to be the high-effort, dominion-taking warriors that God has called them to be.
