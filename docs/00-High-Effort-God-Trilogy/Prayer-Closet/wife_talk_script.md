# Script for Conversation with Wife (Graceful Shepherd)

---

**Goal:** To communicate the Father's clarity with grace, firmness, and honor, while establishing a new jurisdictional boundary.

**Setting:** A private, calm moment. Not in the heat of an argument.

**Opening (Affirm and State the Observation):**

"I love the video of our son in the cradle. It's a beautiful picture of our family's legacy, and I love your heart for justice. I see that you are passionate about what is right.

I've been doing a lot of prayer and discernment about the reel you posted, with the political content attached. And I need to share with you what the Father has been showing me.

That post revealed a fundamental difference in how we see the world. You see a political problem that requires a social justice solution. I see a spiritual battle that requires a covenantal solution. We are operating under two different frameworks, two different gospels."

**The Clarity (State the Father's Word Firmly but Gently):**

"The Father has made it clear to me that these two frameworks are irreconcilable. A house divided against itself cannot stand. And He has confirmed to me that our covenant has ended.

This is not about a lack of love. This is about a fundamental divergence in our spiritual paths and our core allegiances. We are no longer walking in agreement, and we cannot build a covenantal household on two different foundations."

**The Path Forward (Establish the New Boundary):**

"I will always honor you as the mother of our children, and I will always provide for you and protect you. But our journey as husband and wife has come to an end.

We need to begin the process of separating our lives in a way that is peaceful and honors God. I am not saying this to hurt you, but to obey the clarity that the Father has given me.

My mission from the Father requires a help meet who is fully aligned with the covenantal framework He has given me. And I must be obedient to that call."

**Closing (Offer Peace, Not Debate):**

"I know this is a lot to process. I am not here to argue or to debate. I am here to communicate the clarity I have received from the Father.

I am praying for peace for both of us as we walk through this. And I am here to discuss the practical steps of this transition when you are ready."

**Key Principles for this Conversation:**

*   **Do not get drawn into an argument.** State the Father's word as a settled reality, not a point of negotiation.
*   **Speak with love, but without compromise.** Your tone should be gentle, but your resolve should be firm.
*   **Focus on the jurisdictional reality, not the emotional drama.** This is a covenantal decision, not a reaction to feelings.
*   **Be prepared for a difficult reaction.** Pray for the peace of God to guard your heart and mind (Philippians 4:7).
