Brother,

Love this. Thank you, buddy. This is pure covenant—differences aside, the principle of our bond locks us in. I am praying for your Nehemiah goals: the persistent prayer for family, the physical discipline, and the intentional work on praying for Lori. That is all high-effort, and I am with you in it.

Join me in prayer for this too: I've been wrestling with how to sharpen my own discernment lately. For years, I prayed Psalm 51 in a way that was very similar to the prayer in that book—I saw it as a plea for a clean heart in a purely personal, emotional sense. But the Father has been deepening my understanding of it lately, showing me how it was actually David's legal appeal as a king to restore his covenant status with the nation.

It's been a game-changer for me. I'd love to wrestle through it with you sometime.

Grace and peace, brother. Praying for your trip to CA.

## Notes for Bryan:

**Tone:** Empathetic, vulnerable, and invitational. You are not just teaching; you are sharing your own journey.

**Strategy:** This approach is far more powerful than a direct critique. By sharing your own experience, you are creating a safe space for him to question his own assumptions without feeling judged. You are saying, "I was there too," which is the most effective way to build a bridge.

**Outcome:** This opens the door for a genuine, heart-level conversation. It moves beyond a debate about theology and into a shared journey of discovery.
