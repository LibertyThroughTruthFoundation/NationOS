**Subject:** Urgent: Scam Activity in Your Comment Section (WARFARE series)

Grace and peace,

My name is Bryan Pavlovic, and I run the @GodManMarkets channel. I am a huge admirer of your work, especially the new WARFARE series. The content is accurate, uplifting, and desperately needed in the church today.

I am writing to you because I believe your comment section is being targeted by scammers. I left a comment on your latest video and received a reply from a user named "@After-All-t4y-z1m" that was a classic prophetic manipulation scam.

It involved a fake prophetic word, a promise of financial breakthrough, and a call to donate to a supposed orphanage in Nigeria via a WhatsApp number. This is a predatory tactic that preys on the faith of sincere believers.

I have already replied publicly to warn other viewers, but I wanted to bring this to your attention directly so you can take action to protect your flock. This could include moderating comments, blocking the user, or even creating a video to teach your audience about discernment and how to spot these scams.

I would be honored to collaborate with you on creating content that equips the body of Christ to recognize and resist these kinds of spiritual attacks. My work is focused on jurisdictional warfare and building a resilient, discerning remnant.

Thank you for your ministry. I pray for your protection and continued impact.

In His service,

Bryan Pavlovic
