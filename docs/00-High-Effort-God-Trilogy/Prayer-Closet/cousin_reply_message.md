Hey brother,

Love this. Thank you, buddy. This is covenant relationship right here—in spite of circumstantial differences or opinions about those differences, on principle (covenant) you are committing to our relationship. Amen, and thank you.

I'm praying for you as you work through your Nehemiah goals. The focus on specific and persistent prayer for family, the physical discipline, and the intentional work on praying for Lori—that's all solid, high-effort stuff. I'm with you in that.

I'd love to wrestle through some of this prayer material with you sometime. I've been diving deep into the jurisdictional and covenantal layers of Scripture lately, and it's been sharpening how I approach prayer. Things like anger as a signal, understanding as tactical intelligence, conviction as a breach alert—it's been a game-changer for how I lead my family. I think we'd have a really rich conversation about it.

Keep me posted on your CA trip and the family camp board meeting. Praying for safety, wisdom, and fruitful labor.

Grace and peace, brother.

## Notes for Bryan:

**Tone:** Graceful, affirming, and bridge-building. You're honoring his heart and his commitment to the relationship while gently opening the door to deeper theological wrestling.

**Strategy:** You're not critiquing the prayer book directly. You're simply sharing that you've been learning some things that have been helpful for you, and you're inviting him into that conversation when he's ready.

**Outcome:** This keeps the relationship strong while planting a seed for future discipleship. If he's interested, he'll ask. If not, you've still honored him and maintained the covenant bond.
