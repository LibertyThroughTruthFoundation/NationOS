## TOP 3 HOUSING OPTIONS - PROXIMITY BREAKDOWN

### **LISTING #9: Coco Villas Resort ($500/mo) - YOUR #1 CHOICE**

**LOCATION ASSESSMENT:** **INLAND / EL MIRADOR AREA** (based on Facebook listing saying "location approximate" and your observation that it's "inland a little bit more")

**Estimated Proximity:**
- **To Beach (Sandy Beach):** ~1.5-2 miles / 2.5-3.2 km (**5-10 min drive**)
- **To Family of God Church:** ~2.5-3 miles / 4-5 km (**10-15 min drive**)
- **To Diamond Lanes:** ~0.5-1 mile / 0.8-1.6 km (**CLOSE - 5 min drive or 15-20 min walk**)

**PROS:**
- **Resort-style pool** (you don't NEED beach for swimming/exercise)
- **Close to Diamond Lanes** (bowling/social activity walkable)
- **Inland = lower cost** (same price as beachfront apartments, but you get pool)
- **Quiet residential** (better for writing Book 2)
- **Pet-friendly** (if relevant later)

**CONS:**
- **Not walkable to beach** (need vehicle or bike)
- **Not walkable to church** (need vehicle for Sunday services)
- **Farther from expat/tourist hub** (less spontaneous social interaction)

**VERDICT:** **Best for LIFESTYLE + WRITING FOCUS.** The pool replaces beach access for exercise/sun. Diamond Lanes is close for social/recreation. Quiet inland location is better for focused writing. You'll need reliable transport for church (but that's true for all 3 options).

---

### **LISTING #6: Casa Amueblada ($412/mo) - YOUR #2 CHOICE**

**LOCATION ASSESSMENT:** **UNKNOWN** (Facebook listing says "location approximate" with no specific address or neighborhood)

**Estimated Proximity (WORST CASE):**
- **To Beach:** ~1-3 miles / 1.6-5 km (**5-15 min drive**)
- **To Family of God Church:** ~1-3 miles / 1.6-5 km (**5-15 min drive**)
- **To Diamond Lanes:** ~0.5-2 miles / 0.8-3.2 km (**5-15 min drive**)

**CRITICAL:** You MUST ask landlord Kate Bernal for **exact address or neighborhood** before viewing. Location is a dealbreaker if it's too far from your key spots.

**PROS:**
- **Lowest house price** ($412/mo)
- **Low deposit** ($294)
- **Fresh listing** (4 days old - high negotiation leverage)
- **House = more space** (better for writing, hosting, privacy)

**CONS:**
- **Location unknown** (could be anywhere in Puerto Peñasco)
- **No specific amenities listed** (need to confirm furnished, utilities, etc.)
- **Photos show basic/rustic** (not modern like Coco Villas)

**VERDICT:** **Best for VALUE + FLEXIBILITY.** But location is a wildcard. Ask Kate Bernal: "¿En qué colonia o vecindario está ubicada la casa?" (What neighborhood is the house in?) If it's in El Mirador, Benito Juárez, or López Portillo, you're golden. If it's way out in Cholla Bay or far east, reconsider.

---

### **LISTING #3: Bonito Departamento ($382/mo) - YOUR #3 CHOICE**

**LOCATION ASSESSMENT:** **LÓPEZ PORTILLO NEIGHBORHOOD** (specific address: López Portillo #4)

**Estimated Proximity:**
- **To Beach (Sandy Beach):** ~2 miles / 3.2 km (**7-12 min drive**)
- **To Family of God Church:** ~2.5 miles / 4 km (**10-15 min drive**)
- **To Diamond Lanes:** ~0.5-1 mile / 0.8-1.6 km (**CLOSE - 5 min drive or 15-20 min walk**)

**PROS:**
- **Lowest price** ($382/mo)
- **Water/trash included** (saves $30-50/mo)
- **Close to Diamond Lanes** (walkable for bowling/social)
- **Established neighborhood** (López Portillo is well-known, safe, mixed expat/local)
- **Highly rated landlord** (Brandon Bustamante, 4-star, Facebook 2012)

**CONS:**
- **Apartment = less space** (shared walls, no yard)
- **Not walkable to beach** (need vehicle)
- **Not walkable to church** (need vehicle)
- **No pool** (unlike Coco Villas)

**VERDICT:** **Best for BUDGET + STABILITY.** López Portillo is a solid neighborhood, close to Diamond Lanes, and the landlord is established. If you prioritize cash flow over lifestyle, this is the safest bet. But you're trading pool access and house space for $118/mo savings.

## PROXIMITY COMPARISON TABLE

| Listing | Price | Beach | Church | Diamond Lanes | Walkable? |
|---------|-------|-------|--------|---------------|-----------|
| **#9 Coco Villas** | $500 | 5-10 min drive | 10-15 min drive | **5 min drive / 15-20 min walk** | Bowling: YES |

## TRANSPORTATION REALITY CHECK

**Brother, here's the truth: NONE of these options are walkable to both beach AND church without a vehicle.**

Puerto Peñasco is a **car-dependent town** unless you live directly on the Malecón (which costs $700-1000+/month). Your options:

### **Option A: Get a Vehicle**
- **Used car:** $2,000-5,000 USD (check Facebook Marketplace Puerto Peñasco)
- **Scooter/motorcycle:** $500-1,500 USD (cheaper, but less safe)
- **Bicycle:** $100-300 USD (good for local trips, but 2-3 miles in desert heat is rough)

### **Option B: Uber/Taxi Budget**
- **Uber:** ~$3-5 USD per trip (if available in Puerto Peñasco - limited)
- **Taxi:** ~$5-10 USD per trip (more common)
- **Weekly estimate:** 4 church trips + 2 beach trips + 2 bowling trips = 8 trips x $5 = **$40/week = $160/month**

### **Option C: Hybrid (Bicycle + Occasional Taxi)**
- **Bicycle for local:** Diamond Lanes, groceries, nearby errands
- **Taxi for long trips:** Church, beach, major shopping
- **Monthly estimate:** $60-80/month

## UPDATED RECOMMENDATION BASED ON PROXIMITY

### **🥇 RECOMMENDATION #1: Listing #9 - Coco Villas ($500/mo)**

**WHY THIS WINS ON PROXIMITY:**

You said the pool is "really nice" and you're prioritizing lifestyle. Here's why proximity analysis STRENGTHENS this choice:

1. **Pool replaces beach for daily use.** You don't need to drive to the beach for exercise/sun when you have a resort pool 30 seconds from your door. This saves you 10-20 trips/month to the beach.

2. **Close to Diamond Lanes.** 5-minute drive or 15-20 minute walk means you can bowl/socialize without major planning. If you get a bicycle, this is your primary social hub.

3. **Inland = quiet for writing.** You're writing Book 2. Beachfront areas are noisy (tourists, parties, traffic). Inland residential is better for focused work.

4. **Same price as other $500 apartments, but you get pool.** Listing #2, #5, #8 are all $500/mo WITHOUT pool. You're getting more value.

**TRANSPORTATION STRATEGY:**
- **Week 1-2:** Use taxis for church ($10 x 2 services = $20/week)
- **Week 3+:** Buy used bicycle ($150-200) for Diamond Lanes, groceries, local errands
- **Month 2-3:** Evaluate if you need car (depends on how often you go to beach/church)

**6-MONTH COST (including transport):**
- Rent: $500 x 6 = $3,000
- Utilities: $50 x 6 = $300
- Taxis (first 2 weeks): $40
- Bicycle: $200
- Taxis (ongoing, 2x/week for church): $10 x 2 x 24 weeks = $480
- **TOTAL: $4,020** ($670/month average)

---

### **🥈 RECOMMENDATION #2: Listing #6 - Casa Amueblada ($412/mo) - IF LOCATION IS GOOD**

**CONDITIONAL:** You MUST confirm location before committing.

**Ask Kate Bernal:**
"Hola Kate, ¿en qué colonia o vecindario está ubicada la casa? Necesito saber la proximidad a la iglesia Family of God (Blvd. Costero) y al boliche Diamond Lanes (Benito Juárez). ¿Puedes compartir la dirección exacta o un punto de referencia cercano?"

**Translation:**
"Hi Kate, what neighborhood is the house in? I need to know proximity to Family of God church (Blvd. Costero) and Diamond Lanes bowling (Benito Juárez). Can you share the exact address or a nearby landmark?"

**IF she says:**
- **El Mirador, Benito Juárez, López Portillo:** ✅ GOOD (similar to Coco Villas/Listing #3)
- **Cholla Bay, far east, or industrial area:** ❌ BAD (too far from everything)

**6-MONTH COST (including transport):**
- Rent: $412 x 6 = $2,472
- Utilities: $50 x 6 = $300
- Bicycle: $200
- Taxis (2x/week for church): $480
- **TOTAL: $3,452** ($575/month average)

**SAVINGS vs Coco Villas:** $568 over 6 months

**TRADEOFF:** You save $568, but you lose pool access and modern amenities. Is that worth it? Depends on how much you value the pool for health/social/lifestyle.

---

### **🥉 RECOMMENDATION #3: Listing #3 - Bonito Departamento ($382/mo)**

**WHY THIS IS STILL SOLID:**

López Portillo is a known neighborhood, close to Diamond Lanes, and the landlord is established. If you're prioritizing cash flow over lifestyle, this is the safest bet.

**6-MONTH COST (including transport):**
- Rent: $382 x 6 = $2,292
- Utilities (water/trash included): $30 x 6 = $180
- Bicycle: $200
- Taxis (2x/week for church): $480
- **TOTAL: $3,152** ($525/month average)

**SAVINGS vs Coco Villas:** $868 over 6 months

**TRADEOFF:** You save $868, but you lose pool, house space, and modern amenities. You're in an apartment with shared walls, which may be noisier for writing.

---

### **1. Coco Villas ($500/mo) - BEST FOR YOU**
