**The Cozycozy/Flatio Strategy avoids all of this:**

## Important Notes

### For INM Residency Card

When you visit INM to get your Residente Temporal card, you'll need **proof of address** in Mexico.

**Acceptable proof:**
- Rental agreement (even informal)
- Utility bill in your name
- Letter from landlord confirming your address

**For Flatio:** Download rental agreement from Flatio platform (they provide this automatically)

**For Raul/Adrian:** Ask landlord to write a simple letter:

> "This letter confirms that [YOUR NAME] is renting an apartment at [ADDRESS] in Puerto Peñasco, Sonora, Mexico, starting [DATE]. Monthly rent is $[AMOUNT] USD/MXN."
>
> Signed: [Landlord Name]  
> Date: [Date]

### WiFi is Critical

**You're working remotely for Old Glory Foundation.** Ensure every rental has:
- **Reliable WiFi** (ask for speed test results)
- **Backup plan** (mobile hotspot with Telcel or AT&T Mexico)

**Test WiFi immediately upon arrival.** If it's slow, contact landlord or switch to mobile hotspot.

### Utilities

**Typical monthly costs (if not included):**
- Electricity: $30-80 USD (depends on AC usage)
- Water: $10-20 USD
- Internet: $30-50 USD
- Gas (cooking): $10-20 USD

**Total:** $80-170 USD/month

**Flatio usually includes utilities.** Local rentals may or may not—confirm before booking.

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Cozycozy shows no availability for my dates**  
A: Try Airbnb or Vrbo directly. Puerto Peñasco has many listings not indexed by Cozycozy.

**Q: Flatio requires deposit**  
A: Flatio's policy is no deposit, but individual landlords may request one. If so, negotiate or find a different listing.

**Q: Raul/Adrian doesn't respond**  
A: Try calling instead of texting. If no response after 24 hours, search Facebook groups: "Puerto Peñasco Rentals" or "Rocky Point Housing."

**Q: WiFi is too slow for video calls**  
A: Get a Mexican SIM card with data plan (Telcel or AT&T Mexico). Use mobile hotspot as backup. Cost: $20-40/month for 20-50GB.

**Q: Landlord wants 3 months upfront**  
A: This is common for traditional leases. Stick with Flatio or Cozycozy until you have INM card and local bank account, then negotiate better terms.
