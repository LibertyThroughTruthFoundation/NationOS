**COMPARISON:**
This is a STRONG contender. While it's an apartment (not house), the professional landlord, in-unit laundry, and high ratings make it very attractive. Same price as Listing 1 but with better landlord credentials.

---

## LISTING 6: Casa Amueblada (LOWEST PRICE - HOUSE!)

**Price:** MX$7,000/month (~USD $412/month) ⭐⭐
**Deposit:** MX$5,000 (~USD $294) ⭐

**Location:** Puerto Peñasco, Sonora (location approximate)

**Property Details:**
- **Type:** House (Casa)
- **Bedrooms:** Not specified
- **Bathrooms:** Not specified
- **Furnished:** Yes (amueblada)
- **Condition:** Used - Good

**Amenities:**

**Description (Spanish):**

---

## ASSESSMENT - LISTING 6

**PROS:**
- **LOWEST PRICED HOUSE:** $412/month (vs $500-588 for other houses)
- **LOW DEPOSIT:** Only $294 (vs $412-588 for others) ⭐⭐
- **FRESH LISTING:** Only 4 days old (most responsive time)
- **HOUSE not apartment:** More space/privacy
- Furnished

**CONS:**
- No bedroom/bathroom count specified
- No amenities listed
- Photos show basic/rustic property (fenced yard, simple structure)
- Location approximate
- Condition listed as "Used - Good" (not excellent)

**NEGOTIATION POTENTIAL:** VERY HIGH
- Fresh listing (4 days = landlord actively monitoring)
- Low price suggests motivated landlord
- Low deposit shows flexibility
- Perfect time to negotiate month-to-month

**COMPARISON:**
This is the BEST VALUE HOUSE option. $88/month cheaper than Listing 1 (next cheapest house), and $176/month cheaper than Listing 4. The low deposit ($294 vs $500+) is also a huge advantage for your cash flow situation.

**CRITICAL:** You need to ask about bedroom/bathroom count and see more photos, but this could be THE ONE if it's 2bed/1bath minimum.

---

## LISTING 7: Casa Dos Pisos (PREMIUM 3-BEDROOM)

**Price:** MX$11,000/month (~USD $647/month)
**Deposit:** MX$11,000 (~USD $647)

**Location:** Calle Aquiles Serdán, Puerto Peñasco, Sonora 83555 (specific address!)

**Property Details:**
- **Type:** House (Casa) - **TWO STORY** ⭐
- **Bedrooms:** 3 (vs 2 in most others)
- **Bathrooms:** 2
- **Furnished:** Not specified

**Amenities:**
- Modern construction (visible in photos)
- Gated/secure entrance

---

## ASSESSMENT - LISTING 7

**PROS:**
- **3 BEDROOMS** (extra room for office/storage/guests)
- **TWO-STORY HOUSE** (more space, modern design)
- **FRESH LISTING:** 4 days old
- Specific address (Calle Aquiles Serdán)
- Modern/new construction
- Gated/secure

**CONS:**
- **MOST EXPENSIVE:** $647/month (over your $713 budget but close)
- High deposit ($647)
- $235/month more than Listing 6 (cheapest house)
- $147/month more than Listing 1
- May be overkill for single person

**NEGOTIATION POTENTIAL:** MEDIUM
- Fresh listing (4 days)
- High price may limit flexibility
- Modern property suggests landlord invested heavily
- 3BR may sit longer (fewer renters need that much space)

**COMPARISON:**
This is PREMIUM option. If you need office space for writing/recording, the 3rd bedroom is valuable. But it's $235/month more than Listing 6, which is $2,820 over 12 months. Only worth it if you NEED the extra space.

---

## LISTING 8: Departamento Planta Baja

**Price:** MX$8,500/month (~USD $500/month)

**Location:** Puerto Peñasco, Sonora (location approximate)

**Property Details:**

## ASSESSMENT - LISTING 8

**PROS:**
- **Water and trash included** (saves $30-50/month)
- **Ground floor** (no stairs, easier move-in)
- Furnished
- Established landlord (2017)
- Same price as Listings 1, 2, 5 ($500/month)

**CONS:**
- Apartment vs house
- Only 1 bathroom
- Location approximate
- No other amenities listed

**NEGOTIATION POTENTIAL:** MEDIUM
- Listed over a week
- Established landlord
- Water/trash included shows landlord covers some costs

**COMPARISON:**
Similar to Listing 2 (same price, 2bed/1bath apartment), but this one includes water/trash AND is ground floor. However, Listing 3 is still better value at $382/month with water/trash included.

---

## LISTING 9: Coco Villas Departamento (RESORT-STYLE!)

**Price:** MX$8,500/month (~USD $500/month)
**Deposit:** MX$8,500 (~USD $500)

**Location:** Puerto Peñasco, Sonora (location approximate)

**Property Details:**
- **Type:** Apartment (Departamento) in **RESORT COMPLEX** ⭐⭐⭐
- **Bedrooms:** 2
- **Bathrooms:** 1
- **Furnished:** Yes (visible in photos)
- **Pet-friendly:** Dog and cat friendly

**Amenities:**
- **SWIMMING POOL** (shared resort-style pool) ⭐⭐⭐

## ASSESSMENT - LISTING 9

**PROS:**
- **RESORT-STYLE POOL** (huge lifestyle upgrade!)
- Modern complex (looks professionally managed)
- Pet-friendly
- TV included
- Same price as Listings 1, 2, 5, 8 ($500/month)
- Great for hosting/entertaining

**CONS:**
- Apartment vs house
- Only 1 bathroom
- Newer Facebook account (2024) but appears to be property management
- Location approximate
- May have HOA-style rules

**NEGOTIATION POTENTIAL:** MEDIUM-LOW
- Professional property management (less flexibility)
- Pool/amenities suggest fixed pricing
- Listed over a week
- May have standard lease terms

**COMPARISON:**
This is the LIFESTYLE option. Same price as Listing 1 (house), but you get a resort-style pool. If you value outdoor space for exercise, sun, and hosting, this is GOLD. However, it's $118/month more than Listing 3 (cheapest apartment).

**CRITICAL QUESTION:** Is the pool worth $118/month vs Listing 3? Over 6 months, that's $708. But if it keeps you healthy and social, it's worth it.

## TOP 3 RECOMMENDATIONS

### 🥇 **RECOMMENDATION #1: Listing #6 - Casa Amueblada ($412/month)**

**WHY THIS IS THE WINNER:**

This listing offers the best combination of value, flexibility potential, and timing for your situation. At $412/month, it's the lowest-priced house option, saving you $88/month compared to the next cheapest house (Listing #1). The deposit is only $294, which is critical for your cash flow strategy—you can pay first month + last month ($824 total) and still have significant buffer from your Tangem liquidity.

The listing is only 4 days old, meaning the landlord (Kate Bernal) is actively monitoring responses and most likely to engage in flexible negotiations. This is the perfect window to propose your month-to-month arrangement with first/last deposit. The landlord's willingness to list at a lower price and accept a lower deposit suggests motivation and flexibility.

**ACTION ITEMS:**
1. Message Kate Bernal immediately (within 24 hours while listing is fresh)
2. Ask for bedroom/bathroom count and request more photos
3. Propose: "I can pay first month + last month ($824 USD) immediately. I need month-to-month flexibility for 3-6 months while my business income stabilizes, then I'm looking for long-term (1-2 years). Would you be open to this arrangement?"
4. If 2bed/1bath minimum, schedule viewing within 48 hours

**6-MONTH COST:** $2,472 (vs $3,000 for Listing #1)
**SAVINGS:** $528 over 6 months

---

### 🥈 **RECOMMENDATION #2: Listing #3 - Bonito Departamento ($382/month)**

**WHY THIS IS STRONG BACKUP:**

If Listing #6 doesn't work out (wrong bedroom count, landlord inflexible, or property issues), this is your best value option. At $382/month, it's the absolute lowest price, and water/trash are included (saving another $30-50/month). The landlord (Brandon Bustamante) has been on Facebook since 2012 with a 4-star rating, indicating professionalism and reliability.

The tradeoff is apartment vs house (less space, shared walls), but the savings are substantial. Over 6 months, you'd save $708 compared to Listing #1 and $180 compared to Listing #6. This gives you maximum cash flow flexibility while your DeFi positions mature.

**ACTION ITEMS:**
1. Message Brandon Bustamante as backup (within 48 hours)
2. Ask about month-to-month flexibility
3. Same negotiation script as #6
4. Schedule viewing if #6 falls through

**6-MONTH COST:** $2,292 (vs $3,000 for Listing #1)
**SAVINGS:** $708 over 6 months

---

### 🥉 **RECOMMENDATION #3: Listing #9 - Coco Villas Resort ($500/month)**

**WHY THIS IS LIFESTYLE OPTION:**

If you value health, social connection, and quality of life over pure cost savings, this is your choice. The resort-style pool is a game-changer for daily exercise, vitamin D, and hosting potential church family/covenant community. At $500/month, it's the same price as several other apartments, but you get resort amenities.

This is especially valuable if you're planning to stay in Rocky Point long-term and build community. The pool becomes a gathering space for covenant family, a place to decompress after writing sessions, and a health asset (swimming is low-impact cardio). However, it's $118/month more than Listing #3, so you're paying $708 over 6 months for the lifestyle upgrade.

**ACTION ITEMS:**
1. Message Coco Villas (appears to be property management)
2. Ask about month-to-month flexibility (may be less flexible due to professional management)
3. Ask about pool hours, rules, and HOA-style restrictions
4. Schedule viewing if lifestyle upgrade is worth the cost

**6-MONTH COST:** $3,000
**PREMIUM:** $708 over Listing #3 (but pool access daily)

---

## MONTH-TO-MONTH NEGOTIATION STRATEGY

### Your Negotiating Position (STRONG)

**Assets:**
- Can pay first month + last month immediately (shows seriousness)
- American with stable income source (perceived as reliable)
- Long-term potential (1-2 years after flexibility period)
- Clean, professional, church-connected (pastor referral)

**Needs:**
- 3-6 months month-to-month flexibility
- Time for DeFi cash flow positions to mature
- Ability to prove reliability before long-term commitment

### Negotiation Script (English)

"Hello [Landlord Name], I'm very interested in your property. I'm an American writer moving to Puerto Peñasco for long-term residency (1-2 years minimum). I'm connected with Family of God church here, and Pastor [Name] referred me to your listing.

I can pay first month + last month immediately as deposit, which shows my commitment. However, I need month-to-month flexibility for the first 3-6 months while my business income (book royalties and online work) stabilizes from the move. After that period, I'm looking for a stable long-term arrangement.

This actually benefits you as a landlord: you get a reliable tenant who's proven their commitment with double payment upfront, and after the flexibility period, you'll have a long-term tenant who's already settled and happy in the property.

Would you be open to this arrangement? I'm ready to move quickly and can schedule a viewing within 48 hours."

### Negotiation Script (Spanish)

"Hola [Nombre del propietario], estoy muy interesado en su propiedad. Soy un escritor estadounidense que se muda a Puerto Peñasco para residencia a largo plazo (mínimo 1-2 años). Estoy conectado con la iglesia Family of God aquí, y el Pastor [Nombre] me refirió a su anuncio.

Puedo pagar el primer mes + el último mes inmediatamente como depósito, lo que demuestra mi compromiso. Sin embargo, necesito flexibilidad mes a mes durante los primeros 3-6 meses mientras mis ingresos comerciales (regalías de libros y trabajo en línea) se estabilizan después de la mudanza. Después de ese período, busco un arreglo estable a largo plazo.

Esto en realidad le beneficia como propietario: obtiene un inquilino confiable que ha demostrado su compromiso con un pago doble por adelantado, y después del período de flexibilidad, tendrá un inquilino a largo plazo que ya está establecido y feliz en la propiedad.

¿Estaría abierto a este arreglo? Estoy listo para moverme rápidamente y puedo programar una visita dentro de 48 horas."

## CASH FLOW SCENARIOS

### Scenario A: Listing #6 ($412/month)

**Upfront Cost:**
- First month: $412
- Last month (deposit): $412
- **TOTAL: $824**

**6-Month Projection:**
- Months 1-6: $412 x 6 = $2,472
- Utilities (estimated): $50/month x 6 = $300
- **TOTAL: $2,772**

**Budget Remaining:** $713 - $412 = $301/month for food, transport, internet

---

### Scenario B: Listing #3 ($382/month)

**Upfront Cost:**
- First month: $382
- Last month (deposit): $382
- **TOTAL: $764**

**6-Month Projection:**
- Months 1-6: $382 x 6 = $2,292
- Utilities (water/trash included): $30/month x 6 = $180
- **TOTAL: $2,472**

**Budget Remaining:** $713 - $382 = $331/month for food, transport, internet

---

### Scenario C: Listing #9 ($500/month)

**Upfront Cost:**
- First month: $500
- Last month (deposit): $500
- **TOTAL: $1,000**

**6-Month Projection:**
- Months 1-6: $500 x 6 = $3,000
- Utilities (estimated): $50/month x 6 = $300
- **TOTAL: $3,300**

**Budget Remaining:** $713 - $500 = $213/month for food, transport, internet

---

## FINAL RECOMMENDATION SUMMARY

**MOVE FAST on Listing #6 (Casa Amueblada - $412/month).** It's only 4 days old, which means:
1. Landlord is actively monitoring messages
2. Property hasn't been picked over by other renters
3. You have maximum negotiating leverage
4. Timing is perfect for month-to-month proposal

**If Listing #6 doesn't work, immediately pivot to Listing #3 ($382/month).** The savings are too significant to ignore, and the landlord has strong credentials.

**If you value lifestyle and community-building over cost savings, go with Listing #9 ($500/month pool).** But only if you're confident the pool will be used daily and becomes a gathering space for covenant community.

**AVOID Listing #7 ($647/month 3-bedroom)** unless you absolutely need office space and can justify the $235/month premium over Listing #6.

2. **"¿Los servicios están incluidos? (agua, luz, gas, internet, basura)"** (Are utilities included? water, electric, gas, internet, trash)
3. **"¿Está amueblado completamente?"** (Is it fully furnished?)
4. **"¿Estaría abierto a un contrato mes a mes por 3-6 meses, luego largo plazo?"** (Would you be open to month-to-month for 3-6 months, then long-term?)

**Unbowed. Psalm 91. Let's get you housed.**
