## Apostille Process

An **apostille** is a certificate that authenticates the notary's signature for international use. This is required by Mexican immigration.

### Step 1: Identify Your State's Apostille Office

Each US state has a Secretary of State office that issues apostilles.

**Find your state's office:**
- Google: "[Your State] Secretary of State apostille"
- Example: "Arizona Secretary of State apostille"

**Common state offices:**
- **Arizona:** https://azsos.gov/business/notary/apostilles
- **Texas:** https://www.sos.texas.gov/statdoc/apostille.shtml
- **California:** https://www.sos.ca.gov/notary/authentication/
- **Florida:** https://dos.myflorida.com/sunbiz/other-services/apostille-authentication/

### Step 2: Submit for Apostille

**Two methods:**

**Method A: Mail (Most Common)**
1. Make a copy of your notarized letter (keep original safe)
2. Complete apostille request form (download from state website)
3. Include payment (typically $5-20 per document)
4. Mail to Secretary of State office
5. Wait 1-3 weeks for return

**Method B: In-Person (Faster)**
1. Bring notarized letter to Secretary of State office
2. Pay fee at counter
3. Receive apostilled document same day or within hours

### Step 3: Receive Apostilled Document

The apostille will be a separate certificate attached to your notarized letter. **Do not separate them.**

The apostille certifies that the notary's signature is genuine and recognized internationally.

## Spanish Translation (Optional but Recommended)

### Option A: Certified Translator

Hire a certified Spanish translator:
- **Cost:** $30-60 per page
- **Turnaround:** 2-5 business days
- **Find:** Google "certified Spanish translator near me" or use online services like Gengo.com

### Option B: Consulate Translation

Some consulates offer translation services or have translators on staff. Ask when you schedule your appointment.

### Option C: DIY (Not Recommended)

You can translate yourself, but consulates may not accept non-certified translations.

## Important Notes

### For Self-Signing as Director

You are signing this letter as the director of your own foundation. This is **legal and acceptable** because:
1. You are the principal officer of an unincorporated association
2. The foundation is a separate legal entity (via EIN)
3. The employment relationship is genuine (you perform work for the foundation)
4. The salary payments are documented in bank statements

### Consistency is Critical

**The salary amounts in this letter MUST match:**
- Your bank statements (exactly)
- Your Wise transfer records
- Your Mercury/Relay transaction history

Any discrepancy will raise red flags with Mexican immigration.

### Keep Multiple Copies

- **Original apostilled letter:** For consulate submission
- **Certified copy:** For your records
- **Digital scan:** Store in Google Drive and email to yourself

## Troubleshooting

**Q: Can I sign a letter to myself?**  
A: Yes. You are the director of the foundation signing on behalf of the foundation to verify your own employment. This is standard for sole proprietors and foundation directors.

**Q: What if I haven't paid myself for 6-12 months yet?**  
A: Start paying yourself now via Wise. Document 6-12 months before applying for visa. You can apply at consulate once you have sufficient payment history.

**Q: Do I need a lawyer to draft this letter?**  
A: No. This template is sufficient. However, if you want extra assurance, an immigration attorney can review it ($100-300).

**Q: What if the consulate asks for more information?**  
A: Provide your foundation's EIN letter, Mercury/Relay statements, and Wise transaction records. Be prepared to explain your foundation's mission in simple terms: "humanitarian and educational work."
