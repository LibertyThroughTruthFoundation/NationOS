- Do not use wallets previously posted on X, Discord, or GitHub
- This wallet is only for receiving and using unshielded funds later

### Rule 1: Never pay Railgun fees from a wallet that funded the shield

- The wallet that deposits into Railgun must never be used to pay withdrawal gas.
- Treat the funding wallet as permanently tainted once it touches the shield.
- Do not reuse it for anything related to the withdrawal.

**Rule:** Funding wallet ≠ fee payer ≠ receiver.

**LibertySwap Advantage:** Using LibertySwap for both inbound and outbound transactions helps avoid this mistake, because all transaction fees are paid by LibertySwap rather than a linked personal wallet.

---

### Rule 2: If you want to pay the fee yourself, use a decoupled, pre-funded fee payer

- Prepare a fee payer wallet long before any Railgun interaction.
- Fund it from an unrelated source, different timing, different amounts.
- Let it sit idle for days or weeks before use.

**This breaks timing correlation.**

---

### Rule 3: Avoid tight timing between deposit and withdrawal

- Do not withdraw shortly after depositing. Just sitting there in Railgun for a long time. It is very safe.
- Wait long enough to blend into the anonymity set.
- Time variance matters as much as amount variance.

**Bad:** deposit → withdraw within hours  
**Better:** deposit → wait days or longer → withdraw

---

### Rule 4: Use common, non-unique amounts

- Avoid precise or unusual values like 0.099248 ETH.
- Use rounded, common denominations that many users use.
- Unique amounts act as fingerprints.

---

### Rule 5: Do not immediately forward withdrawn funds

- Never withdraw and instantly fund another wallet.
- Add delays, intermediate steps, or additional shielding.
- Immediate forwarding creates deterministic links.

---

### Rule 6: For goodness' sake, do not post your transaction on X right after you make it

- That is basically doxxing yourself.
- Using your own X account while your public addresses are already known is not wise.
- **Once you are in Railgun, disappear.**
