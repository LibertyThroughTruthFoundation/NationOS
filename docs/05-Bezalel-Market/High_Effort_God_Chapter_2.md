# Chapter 2: Jurisdictional Access

To understand the genius of Jesus, we must first understand the spiritual landscape He entered. The world of the Gospels is not a neutral stage; it is a battlefield, a contested territory under the influence of fallen spiritual beings. This is the Divine Council worldview, a framework that is essential for understanding the jurisdictional nature of Jesus' mission.

The concept of the Divine Council is most clearly articulated in Psalm 82:

> "God has taken his place in the divine council; in the midst of the gods he holds judgment... I said, 'You are gods, sons of the Most High, all of you; nevertheless, like men you shall die, and fall like any prince.'"

This is not a reference to the Trinity or to human judges. It is a reference to a council of spiritual beings, "sons of God," who were given authority over the nations. The Septuagint (LXX) and Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) versions of Deuteronomy 32:8 make this explicit:

> "When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance, when he divided mankind, he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the **sons of God**."

At the Tower of Babel, God divided the nations and assigned them to the authority of these spiritual beings. But they rebelled, leading the nations into idolatry and injustice. The Fall, therefore, was not just a human event; it was a cosmic, jurisdictional event. The nations were legally handed over to the authority of these fallen principalities.

This is the context for the spiritual warfare we see throughout the Bible. In Daniel 10, the prophet's prayer is delayed for twenty-one days by the "prince of Persia," a spiritual being with authority over that nation. In Ephesians 6:12, Paul reminds us that "we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places."

Jesus' mission, then, was not simply to teach a new morality. It was a jurisdictional invasion. He came to reclaim the nations from the authority of the fallen sons of God. His exorcisms were not just acts of compassion; they were demonstrations of His authority over the demonic realm. His healings were not just miracles; they were restorations of God's original design for humanity.

When Jesus sent out the seventy-two disciples in Luke 10, He gave them authority over demons and diseases. When they returned, they said, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in your name!" And Jesus replied, "I saw Satan fall like lightning from heaven." This was a declaration of victory. The authority of the fallen sons of God was being broken.

This jurisdictional framework is the key to understanding the Gospels. Jesus was not just a spiritual teacher; He was a warrior-king, reclaiming His rightful inheritance. And He calls us to be part of that mission, to exercise the authority He has given us, and to advance His kingdom in the midst of a contested world.

**Forge Command:** Read Psalm 82 and Deuteronomy 32:8 (LXX). How does this change your understanding of the spiritual world?
