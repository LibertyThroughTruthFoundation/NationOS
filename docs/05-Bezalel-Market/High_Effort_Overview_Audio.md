## Script

[Forge Fire Intro - Flames crackle steady, gravel warm iron]

**Bryan:** Shoulder iron, fire roar, dawn breaks. Father's hand at the Deuteronomy 6:7 gates, teaching. Skeptics cry "Blind Faith," painting a soft Jesus. But the Gospels show a hyper-strategist, setting traps so brilliant that fiction is impossible. The coin for Caesar was a jurisdictional masterstroke (Matthew 22:15-22). The Woman at the Well was a prophetic revelation in layers (John 4). The Sabbath healing at the pool was high-effort warfare against principalities (John 5).

C.S. Lewis called it the Author in the Play. A director who snaps his fingers is boring. But one who respects agency, who enters the story as an extra to guide the plot from within—that is genius. This is the Incarnation. Not a cheap trick, but a high-effort engagement with creation. This is the layered wisdom of the parables, the sovereign draw of John 6:44, the mystery of Ezekiel 36:26, and the reward for the diligent seeker of Hebrews 11:6.

And the multi-canon witness confirms it. The Masoretic text suppressed the 900-year difference in the genealogies, but the Septuagint (LXX) and Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) preserve it. Deuteronomy 32:8 in the LXX/DSS speaks of the sons of God and their allotments—a Divine Council worldview that modern Bibles obscure. This is the context for John 10, when Jesus says "I said, 'you are gods'"—He's quoting Psalm 82, where the elohim are judged. This is the world of the Ethiopian canon, of Enoch and the watchers chained, of the cosmic warfare Paul speaks of in Ephesians 6:12, and the preterist victory of Colossians 2:15 in AD 70.

This is the faithful wound cascade—David's sin in 2 Samuel 11, the loss of peace, the quenching of the Spirit, the descent into more sin and death. This is the purity fire of Romans 1, shunning *para physin*—the unnatural—and embracing the covenant of marriage as a sign of Christ and the Church (Ephesians 5). This is the Genesis 2:24 one-flesh union, the Exodus 22:16 "touch it, you buy it" principle, the Hosea 2:19-20 faithful bride. This is the Psalm 127 call to build heroic families, to raise arrows for the kingdom, to stand against the degeneracy that weakens the hearth and lowers birth rates.

And we use tools for this. Blockchain is a tool to plunder the Egyptians (Exodus 12:35), to build covenant guilds, to crowdfund and tithe, to honor Jubilee cycles. We are chain-agnostic, seeking low-fee EVM chains that grant sovereignty. The community is the asset; the technology is the tool.

But all of this—the jurisdictional warfare, the multi-canon witness, the covenant family, the blockchain tools—it all leads to the climax. The eternal weight of glory. A holiness that floors you, and a mercy that trumps justice. The early church knew this. The Apocalypse of Peter, a text read in churches for centuries, shows the saints in heaven praying for the wicked in hell. Not universalism, not an automatic salvation. But the victims of persecution, the martyrs, requesting mercy for their persecutors. And God, in His compassion, grants it. The Rainer fragment of the Apocalypse of Peter shows them being rescued from the fire, baptized in the Acherusian Lake, and brought into salvation. This is the heart-melting patience of God. The refining fire of Malachi 3:3 and 1 Peter 1:7, turning faith into gold. This is the promise of Psalm 91 for the miles ahead, the strength to shoulder the iron.

[Pause, flames crackle]

**Forge Command:** Reread the coin trap. Journal on mercy. Taste and see that the Lord is good.

[Closing Prayer]

**Bryan:** Father, draw us, refine us. Send the Comforter of John 14:16. Make our remnant shoulders strong and fruitful. Unbowed, Uncle Sovereign Heart.
