## GAB POST: Why the Multi-Canon Witness Matters (For Sola Scriptura Believers)

**Title:** Sola Scriptura & The Multi-Canon Witness: Why the Oldest Manuscripts Matter

### **THE POST**

Brothers & Sisters,

A question for my fellow Sola Scriptura believers: If "Scripture Alone" is our authority, shouldn't we be using the OLDEST and MOST FAITHFUL manuscripts of that Scripture?

Many in the KJV-only camp rightly defend the authority of God's Word, but unknowingly stand on a Masoretic text that is 900 years NEWER than the Septuagint (LXX) manuscripts used by Jesus and the Apostles.

This isn't about adding "extra-biblical" books. This is about RECOVERING the fullness of the biblical witness that has been suppressed or forgotten.

**Consider these three points:**

**1. The Septuagint (LXX) Corrects the Masoretic Text**
- The LXX is the Greek translation of the Hebrew Old Testament, completed ~250 BC.
- The Masoretic Text (the basis for the KJV Old Testament) was compiled by Jewish scribes between 700-1000 AD.
- **Deuteronomy 32:8 (LXX):** "...he set the boundaries of the nations according to the number of the **sons of God**."
- **Deuteronomy 32:8 (Masoretic/KJV):** "...he set the bounds of the people according to the number of the **children of Israel**."

This is not a small difference. The LXX reveals the Divine Council worldview—that God allotted the nations to fallen angelic beings (the "sons of God"), which is the entire basis for the jurisdictional warfare we see in Scripture (Psalm 82, Ephesians 6:12). The Masoretic text obscures this.

**2. The Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) Confirm the LXX**
- Discovered in 1947, the DSS are the oldest Hebrew manuscripts of the Old Testament we have, dating back to the time of Christ.
- In key places like Deuteronomy 32:8, the DSS agree with the LXX ("sons of God"), NOT the later Masoretic text.
- This is external, archaeological proof that the LXX is a more faithful witness to the original Hebrew text.

**3. The Ethiopian Canon Preserves Lost Books**
- The Ethiopian Orthodox Church has the oldest and most complete biblical canon on earth (81 books).
- It includes books like **Enoch** and **Jubilees**, which were quoted by Jesus and the Apostles (Jude 1:14-15 quotes Enoch 1:9 directly) and found among the Dead Sea Scrolls.
- These books are not "New Age"—they are ancient Hebrew texts that fill in crucial gaps in our understanding of the cosmic war, the fallen angels (watchers), and the origins of evil.

**Sola Scriptura does not mean "KJV Alone." It means SCRIPTURE is our ultimate authority.**

Therefore, a true commitment to Sola Scriptura should lead us to embrace the oldest, most complete, and most apostolically-affirmed manuscripts:

- The **Septuagint** for its apostolic authority and correction of the Masoretic.
- The **Dead Sea Scrolls** for their archaeological confirmation.
- The **Ethiopian Canon** for its preservation of books quoted in the New Testament.

This isn't about abandoning the KJV. It's about enriching our understanding of it with the fullness of the witness that was available to Jesus and the early church.

Iron sharpens iron. Let us not be afraid to dig deeper.

Soli Deo Gloria.
