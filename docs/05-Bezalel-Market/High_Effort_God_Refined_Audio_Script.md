## Script

[Forge Fire Intro - Flames crackle steady]

**Bryan:** Shoulder iron, fire roar, dawn breaks. Father's hand at the Deuteronomy 6:7 gates, teaching. Skeptics cry "Blind Faith," painting a soft Jesus. But the Gospels show a hyper-strategist, setting traps so brilliant that fiction is impossible. The coin for Caesar was a jurisdictional masterstroke (Matthew 22:15-22). The Woman at the Well was a prophetic revelation in layers (John 4). The Sabbath healing at the pool was high-effort warfare against principalities (John 5).

C.S. Lewis called it the Author in the Play. A director who snaps his fingers is boring. But one who respects agency, who enters the story as an extra to guide the plot from within—that is genius. This is the Incarnation. Not a cheap trick, but a high-effort engagement with creation. This is the layered wisdom of the parables, the sovereign draw of John 6:44, the mystery of Ezekiel 36:26, and the reward for the diligent seeker of Hebrews 11:6.

And the multi-canon witness confirms it. The Masoretic text suppressed the 900-year difference in the genealogies, but the Septuagint (LXX) and Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) preserve it. Deuteronomy 32:8 in the LXX/DSS speaks of the sons of God and their allotments—a Divine Council worldview that modern Bibles obscure. This is the context for John 10, when Jesus says "I said, 'you are gods'"—He's quoting Psalm 82, where the elohim are judged. This is the world of the Ethiopian canon, of Enoch and the watchers chained, of the cosmic warfare Paul speaks of in Ephesians 6:12, and the preterist victory of Colossians 2:15 in AD 70.

Blockchain is a tool for this high-effort community. A way to plunder the Egyptians (Exodus 12:35) and build a covenant treasury. We are chain-agnostic, seeking principles, not idols. We look for low-fee EVM chains that allow for sovereignty, for crowdfunding and tithing, for Jubilee cycle resets. The technology serves the community; the community is the asset.

This isn't theory. This is rubber-meets-the-road fruit. This is the arrow dodge with Bella, the grace of Proverbs 18:22, the promise of Psalm 84:11 that no good thing is withheld from those who walk uprightly. This is the refining fire of Malachi 3:3, turning faith into gold.

And this all leads to something even more profound. A mercy that floors you. A justice that is holy, but a compassion that trumps it. We'll get to that. But first, you have to understand the warfare.

[Pause, flames crackle]

**Forge Command:** Reread the coin trap. Journal on jurisdiction.

[Closing Prayer]

**Bryan:** Father, draw us, refine us. Give us shoulders strong enough for the iron. Psalm 91 for the miles ahead. Unbowed, Uncle Sovereign Heart.
