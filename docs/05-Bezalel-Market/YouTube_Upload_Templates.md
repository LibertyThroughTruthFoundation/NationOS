## 📋 TIER 1: UPLOAD TEMPLATES (High-Impact Foundation)

### **1. The High-Effort God: Jesus' Jurisdictional Genius**

**Title:** The High-Effort God: Jesus' Jurisdictional Genius Proves the Gospel

**Description:**
Modern Christianity has been sold a low-effort god—a soft, mythical Jesus who wanders around giving good advice. But the Jesus of the Gospels is a hyper-strategist, a master of jurisdictional warfare who sets traps so brilliant that His opponents could not escape them.

This is the thesis of my upcoming book, "The High-Effort God: Jesus' Jurisdictional Genius Proves the Gospel."

In this video overview, we explore:
• The "Author in the Play" concept (C.S. Lewis)
• The Divine Council worldview (Psalm 82, Deuteronomy 32:8 LXX)
• The coin trap (Matthew 22:15-22) as jurisdictional genius
• The Sabbath healing (John 5) as warfare against principalities
• The high-effort path of seeking God (Hebrews 11:6)

This is not your typical Sunday school lesson. This is a military briefing on the Gospel.

### **2. What is Money? From Hype to Covenant Value**

**Title:** What is Money? From Hype to Covenant Value (Explained for a 5th Grader)

**Description:**
Money isn't just paper or numbers on a screen. It's a covenant. It's a promise. It's a measure of trust.

In this video, we break down the concept of money to a 5th-grade level, explaining the difference between hype-based value (like most crypto) and covenant-based value (the biblical blueprint).

This is the foundational video for understanding Covenant Finance.
