## THE 5 IMMUTABLE CREED GATES

NationOS stands firmly against these 5 categories of theological compromise. Any artwork, content, or teaching that violates these boundaries must be rejected according to Deuteronomy 13:5.

### 1. **Syncretism Rejection** (סִינְקְרֶטִיזְם דְּחִיָּה - Sinkretizm Deḥiyyah)
**Definition:** No blending of Biblical truth (multi-canon MT/LXX-DSS/Ethiopian) with pagan religions, modern Judaism, or "Judeo-Christian" mythology.

**Key Distinctions:**
- Biblical Israel ≠ Modern Israel (no mandate to support modern nation-state)
- Ancient Judaism (Torah-based) ≠ Modern Rabbinic Judaism (Talmud-based)
- Christian faith is distinct, not a subset of Judaism

**Biblical Foundation:** Deuteronomy 13:1-5 (false prophet test), Galatians 1:8-9 (no other gospel)

---

### 2. **Egalitarianism Rejection** (אֵגָלִיטַרְיוֹנִיזְם דְּחִיָּה - Egalitarianizm Deḥiyyah)
**Definition:** Rejection of the flattening of God's created order and natural hierarchy.

**Affirmations:**
- Patriarchal structure: Men as protectors (Ephesians 5), women as ezer kenegdo nurturers (Genesis 2:18, Psalm 127)
- Binary sex is immutable (Genesis 1:27)
- Natural hierarchy in family, church, and nation

**Rejections:**
- Feminism (rejection of biblical womanhood)
- LGBTQ ideology (rejection of binary sex and marriage design)
- DEI/anti-White ideology (anti-ethnos, James 2:1-9)

**Biblical Foundation:** Ephesians 5:22-33, Genesis 1:27, Titus 1:12 (Cretan test)

---

### 3. **Anthropocentrism/Humanism Rejection** (אַנְתְרוֹפּוֹצֶנְטְרִיזְם דְּחִיָּה - Anthropotzentrizm Deḥiyyah)
**Definition:** Rejection of man-centered worldview in favor of God-centered sovereignty.

**Affirmations:**
- Divine Council worldview (Deuteronomy 32:8, Psalm 82:8)
- God's sovereignty over nations and ethnos (blood/heritage matter)
- Natural law and created order

**Rejections:**

- Humanistic "all people are equal" ideology
- Empowerment of mediocrity and alien cultures (Titus 1:12)
- Great Replacement (demographic destruction of ethnos)

**Biblical Foundation:** Deuteronomy 32:8 (sons of God/nations), Psalm 82:8 (mišpāṭ), Romans 1:18-32 (suppression of truth)

---

### 4. **Transhumanism Rejection** (טְרַנְסְהוּמַנִיזְם דְּחִיָּה - Transhumanizm Deḥiyyah)
**Definition:** Rejection of technological redefinition of humanity and God's created order.

**Affirmations:**
- Human order is immutable (race, biology, IQ are heritable)
- Life begins at conception (abortion is murder)
- Natural hierarchy is God-ordained

**Rejections:**
- Technological "resurrection" or immortality projects
- Genetic engineering to "improve" humanity
- AI/tech redefinition of marriage, gender, or personhood
- DEI as forced equality against natural hierarchy

**Biblical Foundation:** Genesis 1:27 (image of God), Psalm 139:13-16 (womb formation), Colossians 2:15 (preterist eschatology—no future Beast system)

---

### 5. **Replacement/Encroachment Rejection** (הַחְלָפָה פְּלִיגָה דְּחִיָּה - Haḥlafah Peligah Deḥiyyah)
**Definition:** Rejection of demographic replacement and destruction of organic nations.

**Affirmations:**
- Ethnos gates (Deuteronomy 23:3-8, Titus 1:12 patterns)
- Blood and heritage matter (Romans 9:27 remnant)
- Nations have boundaries and identities

**Rejections:**
- Mass immigration orchestrated by elites
- Great Replacement (demographic destruction)
- "Nation of immigrants" mythology
- Destruction of organic blood/heritage nations

**Biblical Foundation:** Deuteronomy 23:3-8 (assembly gates), Titus 1:12 (Cretan patterns), Romans 9:27 (remnant principle)

## ARTWORK AUDIT PROTOCOL

All visual theology, branding, and creative assets must be audited against these 5 Creed Gates:

1. **Syncretism Check:** Does the artwork blend Christian imagery with pagan symbols (e.g., yin-yang, Hindu mandalas, New Age sacred geometry)?
2. **Egalitarianism Check:** Does the artwork promote gender confusion, feminism, or rejection of biblical hierarchy?
3. **Anthropocentrism Check:** Does the artwork center man instead of God? Does it promote humanistic "equality" over divine order?
4. **Transhumanism Check:** Does the artwork glorify technology, AI, or genetic enhancement as salvific?
5. **Replacement Check:** Does the artwork promote globalism, mass immigration, or destruction of ethnos?

**Violation Response:** Any artwork that violates these boundaries must be flagged, documented, and either corrected or removed according to Deuteronomy 13:5.
