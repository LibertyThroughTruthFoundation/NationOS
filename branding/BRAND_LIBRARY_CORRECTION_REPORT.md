## THEOLOGICAL RATIONALE

### Why Star of David is Syncretism
- Star of David (Magen David) is **NOT found in the Bible**
- It became associated with Judaism in the **17th century CE** (post-Biblical)
- Adopted by Zionism in the 19th century as a **political symbol**
- Modern Israel uses it on their flag, but **Biblical Israel ≠ Modern Israel** (Creed Gate #1)
- Using it conflates Biblical faith with **modern Rabbinic Judaism** (Talmud-based, not Torah-based)
- **Hexagram has occult associations:** Seal of Solomon, Kabbalah, Hermetic magic

### Why "Sacred Geometry" is Syncretism
- "Sacred geometry" is a **New Age/occult term** rooted in Pythagorean/Platonic mysticism
- Suggests mathematical patterns are **inherently divine** (anthropocentrism)
- **Biblical view:** God created order and patterns, but the patterns themselves are not "sacred"
- Golden ratio/Fibonacci spirals are **mathematical observations**, not spiritual truths
- Violates Creed Gate #1 (Syncretism) and #3 (Anthropocentrism)

### Why Pentagram Stars are Problematic
- 5-pointed stars (pentagrams) have **occult associations** (pentacle, Wicca, Satanism)
- While also used in heraldry/flags, context matters
- In a theological brand library, **avoid all ambiguity** regarding occult symbols
- Replaced with circular medallions to eliminate any occult association
