_# Lawsuit Portfolio Summary: The Two-Front War_

**Date:** January 25, 2026

## I. Executive Summary

This document summarizes the active legal fronts being pursued, which constitute a coordinated "Two-Front War" against institutional overreach. The first front targets **Financial Tyranny** through institutions like PayPal and Chase Bank, which are engaging in systemic custodial fraud and obstruction of property rights. The second front targets **Therapeutic Tyranny** through organizations like the Marriage Recovery Center (MRC), which engage in spiritual malpractice and third-party covenant abuse.

Both fronts represent a unified assault on individual sovereignty, agency, and property rights, employing similar tactics of creating arbitrary barriers, using "security" as a pretext for control, and coercing individuals into compliance.

## II. Front 1: Financial Tyranny (Unjust Scales)

This front addresses the systemic obstruction of access to personal digital assets by financial institutions.

### A. PayPal Holdings, Inc.

*   **Case:** Systemic Custodial Fraud & Obstruction of Property Rights.
*   **Incident:** Blocked withdrawal of 0.0071 BTC, demanding irrelevant "location verification" for a cryptographic transfer. Coerced user to "sell the asset" for fiat rather than take self-custody.
*   **Legal Analysis:**
    *   **Constructive Fraud & Conversion:** By selling a derivative asset that they refuse to deliver, PayPal engages in conversion.
    *   **Deceptive Trade Practices:** Marketing a seamless crypto experience while creating a labyrinth of holds and arbitrary blocks.
*   **Status:** Legal memorandum prepared for counsel (Robert J. Campos, Esq.). Formal complaint to be filed with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).

### B. Chase Bank

*   **Case:** Unlawful Retention of Assets & Obstruction of Sovereign Financial Activity.
*   **Incident:** Repeatedly blocked Zelle transfers ($1,500) to a verified crypto on-ramp (0xCoast), citing vague "security" concerns and conducting intrusive, unnecessary verification.
*   **Legal Analysis:**
    *   **Unlawful Restriction of Funds:** Violates EFTA/Reg E by preventing a customer from accessing their own funds for a legitimate transaction.
    *   **Pattern of Deception:** Mirrors PayPal's tactics of feigning cooperation while systematically obstructing transfers to non-traditional financial platforms.
*   **Status:** Dossier created, documenting all interactions. Escalation to Chase supervisors and a CFPB complaint are the next steps.

## III. Front 2: Therapeutic Tyranny (Spiritual Malpractice)

This front addresses the abuse of therapeutic and counseling authority to violate covenant relationships and individual agency.

### A. Marriage Recovery Center (MRC)

*   **Case:** Third-Party Covenant Abuse & Spiritual Malpractice.
*   **Key Figures:** Dr. David Hawkins (Founder), Ernest Wilson (Counselor).
*   **Incident:** The MRC model was used to pathologize normal masculine behavior, diagnose "narcissistic abuse" without proper grounds, and systematically dismantle a covenant marriage under the guise of "therapy." This represents a gross overreach of therapeutic authority and a violation of the sacred covenant between husband and wife.
*   **Legal Analysis:**
    *   **Spiritual Malpractice:** Applying a flawed and harmful therapeutic model that leads to the destruction of a covenant relationship.
    *   **Third-Party Covenant Interference:** Usurping the husband's headship and the wife's agency by imposing a destructive, unbiblical framework.
*   **Status:** Case theory and strategic focus documents have been drafted. A call to repentance has been issued to Ernest Wilson. This case serves as the spiritual parallel to the financial tyranny cases, demonstrating a unified pattern of institutional control.

## IV. Unified Strategy: The Two-Front War

The strategic insight is that these are not isolated incidents but a coordinated assault on sovereignty. The financial institutions and the therapeutic institutions are two heads of the same beast, both seeking to control, pathologize, and ultimately dispossess individuals of their God-given agency and property.

By pursuing these cases in parallel, we expose the systemic nature of the problem and build a powerful narrative of institutional overreach that can serve as a rallying cry for the remnant. The evidence from the financial front strengthens the case on the spiritual front, and vice versa, demonstrating a consistent pattern of "tyranny" across different domains.
