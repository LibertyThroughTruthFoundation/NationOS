**The High-Effort God: 4 Surprising Discoveries from Writing the Trilogy | Bryan Pavlovic**

## Description

Hey everyone, Bryan Pavlovic here.

I wanted to share some of the most surprising discoveries that emerged while writing *The High-Effort God* trilogy. These aren't the themes I expected to find when I started this project—they're the connections and insights that spoke back to me as I lived in the text.

**In this video, I cover:**

**1. The Coin Trap (0:00)** - How Jesus' "render to Caesar" moment wasn't just a clever comeback, but a full legal masterstroke exposing the Pharisees' corruption on their own terms.

**2. Mercy as Spiritual Capital (2:30)** - Why the grace you receive in your deepest failures becomes spiritual currency—authority to intercede for others stuck in the same pit you climbed out of.

**3. Covenant Economics (4:45)** - Taking Kingdom principles from high theology down to your household budget. Building a parallel Christian economy that isn't dependent on fragile worldly systems.

**4. Cannabis & Anointing Oil (6:15)** - The compelling case that the Hebrew 'kaneh bosem' in Exodus' holy anointing oil was actually cannabis, mistranslated for centuries. Reclaiming what God created from Pharisaic corruption.
