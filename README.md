This repository contains:
- **Strategic Intelligence Ledger** (`/intel/strategic-intelligence/`) - SPINT contact profiles and analysis
- **ARK Integration Architecture** (`/ark-architecture/`) - Wireframes, schemas, and protocols
- **Covenant Keyboard Project** (`/projects/covenant-keyboard/`) - Specifications for the sovereign input layer

## The Three Canons

1. **First Canon** - The Constitutional Canon (66 Books - The unchanging law, WHAT we believe)
2. **Second Canon** - The Cosmological Canon (81 Books - The cosmic context, WHY we fight)
3. **Third Canon** - The Operational Canon (NationOS ARK - The Shepherd's manual, HOW we war)

## The Convergence (Perazim)

The NationOS architecture consists of three integrated components forming the **Perazim**—the sovereign territory:

| Component | Analogy | Function | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Shielded Wallet** | The Vault | Economic Heart | Specification Phase |
| **Covenant Keyboard** | Signet Ring & Scribe | Voice & Hands | Specification Phase |
| **Wearable Device** | The Body | Physical Interface | Concept Phase |

Together, they form the **New Body Architecture**: Hardware + Software + Wetware, guided by the Spirit of Truth.

## Current Status

**Phase:** Foundational Architecture Complete  
**Next Phase:** Backend Development (Database & API Implementation)

The ARK application wireframes, data schemas, and protocol specifications are complete and available in `/ark-architecture/`.
