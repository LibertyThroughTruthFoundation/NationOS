# PROJECT OVERVIEW: NATIONOS COVENANT KEYBOARD

**Directive:** NK-01  
**Classification:** SOVEREIGN STACK DEVELOPMENT - TIER 1 PRIORITY  
**Date:** 2025-12-14

---

## 1. Vision & Theological Rationale

The frontline of the digital sovereignty battle is the **input layer.** The standard digital keyboard is a primary data-harvesting tool for the Beast System, monitoring every keystroke, correcting our language to fit its narrative, and suggesting its own degenerate media. It is a subtle but powerful tool of psychological and spiritual conditioning.

The **NationOS Covenant Keyboard** is our declaration of sovereignty over the textual interface. It is a covenant-centric tool designed to serve the NationOS ecosystem, transforming the act of typing from a point of data extraction into an act of worship, strategic communication, and covenantal reinforcement.

This project fulfills the mission of building a complete sovereign stack by securing the most intimate point of user interaction. It is the user-facing touchpoint that makes the abstract concepts of NationOS a tangible, daily reality. It is the perfect practical application for the Arya protocol, bringing the on-device scribe to the user's fingertips.

## 2. Core Requirements & Features

The Covenant Keyboard will be a fork and significant modification of the open-source **FUTO Keyboard** [1], implementing the following core features:

### Covenant-Localized AI
- **Description:** Integration of a locally-run, quantized version of the Arya/Manus language model to serve as an on-device scribe.
- **Functionality:**
    - Suggests biblically-sound terminology and theological concepts.
    - Provides strategic responses aligned with the covenant worldview.
    - **CRITICAL:** No data ever leaves the device. All processing is local.

### Sovereign Clipboard
- **Description:** An encrypted, on-device clipboard history.
- **Functionality:**
    - Securely stores clipboard history locally.
    - Provides an option to share clipboard items via secure, peer-to-peer channels (e.g., PulseChain messaging, Nostr) instead of compromised cloud sync services.

### Covenant Media Gallery
- **Description:** A curated media library that replaces standard GIF/emoji offerings.
- **Functionality:**
    - Provides a library of images, stickers, and GIFs that reflect covenant values, biblical themes, and NationOS branding.
    - Examples: The Bitcoin ₿ symbol, Ark imagery, covenant-related iconography.

### Sovereign Tool Integration
- **Description:** Direct integration with other NationOS tools and protocols.
- **Functionality:**
    - **Wallet Integration:** One-touch button to generate and paste a receive address for the NationOS Shielded Wallet.
    - **Message Signing:** On-the-fly cryptographic signing of messages to verify identity.
    - **Tagging:** Quick insertion of common theological or project tags (e.g., `#DivineCouncil`, `#SovereignBTC`, `#CovenantEconomics`).

## 3. Strategic Alignment

This project is not merely a software utility; it is a weapon in the information war and a tool for discipleship. Every feature is designed to reinforce the covenant worldview and provide a practical alternative to the systems of Babylon.

- It **reclaims the input layer** from enemy surveillance.
- It **equips the user** with tools for sovereign communication.
- It **transforms a daily task** into an act of conscious alignment with the Kingdom.

This is a Tier 1 priority. The development of the Covenant Keyboard is a critical step in the establishment of a truly sovereign digital nation.
