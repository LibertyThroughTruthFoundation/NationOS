# Project: Covenant Curriculum

**Directive:** END_OF_DAY_01
**Date:** 2025-12-14
**Status:** Project Initiated

## 1. Vision

To provide a biblical theology supplement to the Tuttle Twins series, connecting their libertarian principles to their foundation in Scripture. This project serves as a bridge for families who have embraced philosophical liberty to discover its ultimate source in theological truth.

## 2. Phase 1: Parent's Guide PDF

The initial deliverable will be a short, beautifully designed "Parent's Guide" PDF that can be distributed for free. This guide will cover three core concepts:

### A. Property Rights & The 8th Commandment
- **Tuttle Twins Concept:** The Law of Property
- **Biblical Foundation:** "You shall not steal" (Exodus 20:15) as the basis for private property. God as the ultimate owner, man as the steward.
- **Key Verses:** Leviticus 25:23, 1 Kings 21 (Naboth's Vineyard)

### B. Sound Money & Biblical Weights/Measures
- **Tuttle Twins Concept:** The Golden Rule & Honest Money
- **Biblical Foundation:** "You shall have just balances, just weights..." (Leviticus 19:36). The sin of debasing currency as a form of theft and injustice.
- **Key Verses:** Proverbs 11:1, Amos 8:5

### C. Entrepreneurship & The Parable of the Talents
- **Tuttle Twins Concept:** The Miraculous Pencil & Free Markets
- **Biblical Foundation:** The Parable of the Talents (Matthew 25:14-30) as a mandate for productive stewardship and risk-taking.
- **Key Verses:** Proverbs 31:10-31 (The Virtuous Woman as Entrepreneur)

## 3. Phase 2: Outreach Strategy

Once the Parent's Guide is complete, the next phase will be to develop a respectful and strategic outreach plan to Connor Boyack, the founder of the Tuttle Twins series. The goal is not to co-opt his work, but to offer this as a supplemental resource for his existing audience.

## 4. Strategic Importance

This project is a **generational legacy** initiative. It is the first step in building a complete educational framework that equips the next generation of covenant families to think biblically about economics, governance, and liberty.

This is not just about teaching children; it is about **equipping parents to disciple their children** in the principles of a free and sovereign nation under Christ-centered worldview.
