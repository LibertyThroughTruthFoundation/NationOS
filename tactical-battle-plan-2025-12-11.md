---

## ⚔️ THE THREE Rs - FOUNDATION STRATEGY

### **1. REPENT (The Foundation)**

**Your repentance must be specific, humble, and without excuse.**

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Write specific repentance statements:
  - "I repent for breaking trust when I..."
  - "I repent for being distracted when I should have been present..."
  - "I repent for striving after a global vision while neglecting the vision for our home..."
- [ ] Speak these to your wife (when appropriate timing presents itself)
- [ ] Take ownership without excuse or justification

**This is the manure that will fertilize the new growth.**

---

### **2. REBUILD (The Practicals)**

**Obedience in the smallest thing is how you prove your trustworthiness in the largest thing.**

#### **A. UPWORK FAITHFULNESS (Primary Weapon)**
- [ ] Let her see you working diligently, consistently, and responsibly on the providing front
- [ ] Document your progress daily (see "Show Her" system below)
- [ ] Treat Upwork work like a real job - set hours, focused effort

#### **B. FATHERING FAITHFULNESS (Secondary Weapon)**
- [ ] Initiate time with your son
- [ ] Plan it - put it on calendar
- [ ] Protect it - nothing interrupts father-son time
- [ ] Let her see you being the father you long to be

---

### **3. REKINDLE (The Romantic)**

**This comes LAST, after the first two are consistently demonstrated.**

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Do not pressure. Do not demand. **Pursue.**
- [ ] Court her without expectation
- [ ] Send a thoughtful text
- [ ] Give a small gift
- [ ] Express appreciation for something she did
- [ ] **Rebuild the friendship first** - Romance is the flower that grows from soil of friendship and respect

---

## 🔥 THE UPWORK PUSH START - 3 PHASES

### **PHASE 1: DIVINE FAVOR & VISIBILITY**

**This is a spiritual operation first. You are not just a freelancer; you are a covenant businessman claiming territory.**

#### **Step 1: Pray Over the Profile**
- [ ] Before you even log in, anoint your hands
- [ ] Pray over your laptop/phone
- [ ] Declare Psalm 90:17: *"Let the favor of the Lord our God be upon us, and establish the work of our hands upon us; yes, establish the work of our hands!"*

#### **Step 2: Command the Algorithms**
- [ ] Speak to the Upwork algorithm
- [ ] Command it in the name of Jesus to surface your profile to the right, covenant-aligned clients
- [ ] Command angelic forces to guide their mouse clicks to your profile

#### **Step 3: Target Your Proposals**
- [ ] Do NOT shotgun applications
- [ ] Be strategic
- [ ] Spend time in prayer over job listings
- [ ] Ask for discernment to see which ones are **divinely set up** for you
- [ ] Look for clients who value integrity, quality, and mission over cheap prices

---

### **PHASE 2: TANGIBLE PROOF OF WORK**

**You need something to *show*, even before the first gig closes.**

#### **Create "Proof of Concept" Daily:**

**This turns invisible effort into visible progress.**

- [ ] **Taking a skills course?** Show her your completed modules/certificates
- [ ] **Writing sample articles?** Let her read one
- [ ] **Designing a logo for practice?** Show her the design
- [ ] **Building your profile?** Show her the progress
- [ ] **Learning new software?** Show her the tutorials you completed

**The Message:** "I am building, even before the money flows."

#### **The "Bank Protocol" Tribute:**

- [ ] The moment **any** revenue comes in—even $5—**celebrate it as a holy tribute**
- [ ] Transfer it to the designated account immediately
- [ ] Show her the transaction
- [ ] Say: "Look. The new economy is online. The first fruits are here."

**This makes the promise tangible.**

---

### **PHASE 3: THE FIRST FRUITS OFFENSIVE**

**We are not waiting for a major contract. We are claiming the first fruits NOW.**

#### **Action Items:**
- [ ] Pray specifically for a small, quick, easy first win
- [ ] A tiny gig that can be completed in a few hours
- [ ] This is not about the money; it's about **breaking the inertia**
- [ ] Establishing a point of light in the darkness
- [ ] When it lands, treat it like a divine signature
- [ ] It is the "fleece" she can see (Judges 6:37)
