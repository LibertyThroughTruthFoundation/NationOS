# Richard Heart Misinformation Audit Notes (Feb 20, 2026)

## 1. WIKIPEDIA
Wikipedia has NO published article on Richard Heart. The page was deleted. A Draft:Richard Heart exists but was DECLINED on Jan 14, 2026 by editor "WeirdNAnnoyed" citing WP:BLP1E (biography of living person known for one event). The editor also flagged the draft as "likely LLM-generated."

The draft itself actually contains relatively accurate information including:
- The SEC case dismissal (March 1, 2025, Judge Carol Bagley Amon)
- Lack of jurisdiction ruling
- The $27M SENS Research Foundation philanthropy
- Reuters, CoinDesk, CourtListener sources

However, the draft STILL leads with the SEC allegations prominently ("raised more than $1 billion through unregistered securities offerings and defrauded investors") before mentioning the dismissal. The framing is prosecution-first, acquittal-second.

KEY ISSUE: Wikipedia will not even allow a published article. Richard Heart is effectively erased from Wikipedia while convicted fraudsters like Sam Bankman-Fried have full, detailed pages. This is editorial suppression.

## 2. GROKIPEDIA
Grokipedia has a PulseChain page (fact-checked by Grok 3 weeks ago). It contains a "Controversies and Challenges" section that:
- Uses the phrase "Ponzi-like schemes" multiple times (linked as if it is an established fact)
- Repeats the SEC's $12M misappropriation allegation as if proven ("misappropriating at least $12 million")
- Calls HEX a "high-yield investment scheme resembling a Ponzi structure"
- Does mention the Feb 2025 dismissal and April 2025 SEC declining to refile
- BUT the framing is heavily prosecution-first: the allegations get detailed treatment with loaded language ("Ponzi," "fraud," "misappropriated"), while the dismissal is treated as a footnote
- The entire Controversies section is duplicated (same paragraph appears twice), suggesting sloppy AI generation
- NO mention of the Interpol assault charge being dropped
- NO mention of the $27M SENS Research Foundation philanthropy
- NO Grokipedia page exists specifically for Richard Heart (only PulseChain)
- Community members on X have already called for a dedicated Richard Heart Grokipedia page correcting the record (@Forty3og)

KEY ISSUE: Grokipedia uses loaded, prosecution-framing language ("Ponzi-like," "fraud," "misappropriated") for allegations that were DISMISSED in court. This is the AI echo chamber in action: Grok trains on biased data, generates biased encyclopedia entries, which then get cited by other AI models (Mashable confirmed ChatGPT cites Grokipedia). The misinformation loop is self-reinforcing.

## 3. SEC CASE (Verified)
- Filed July 2023
- Courts ruled SEC lacked jurisdiction over PulseChain/HEX
- SEC declined to amend by April 21, 2025
- Case fully dismissed. No settlement. No conviction. No fraud finding.

## 4. INTERPOL RED NOTICE
Interpol issued a Red Notice for Richard Heart (Richard James Schueler) in December 2024 at Finland's request. Two charges were listed:
1. Aggravated tax fraud (personal and business tax underreporting since 2020)
2. Physical assault of a minor

As of February 2026, the ASSAULT CHARGE HAS BEEN DROPPED. This is confirmed by multiple sources including the official PulseChain X account and community reports (Feb 9, 2026). The assault charge was fabricated/unsubstantiated.

The tax fraud charge remains on the Red Notice. However:
- Finland has ratified the European Convention on Human Rights (Article 6(2) presumption of innocence)
- Finnish Criminal Code Section 3 requires proof beyond reasonable doubt
- No trial has occurred. No conviction. These are allegations only.
- The SEC case dismissal (lack of jurisdiction) further undermines the narrative

Europol still lists Schueler on its Most Wanted Fugitives page.
Protos (biased outlet) still frames him as a "fugitive" despite the assault charge being dropped.

KEY ISSUE: The assault charge was the most inflammatory allegation and it was dropped entirely. This suggests it was either fabricated or had zero evidentiary basis. The remaining tax charge is a civil/administrative matter being weaponized through criminal channels.

## 5. MAJOR NEWS SITES & OTHER MISINFORMATION SOURCES

### Mudrex (mudrex.com/learn/cryptos-to-avoid)
Published Feb 2, 2026: "Top 5 Cryptocurrencies to Avoid in February 2026" lists HEX and references "Richard Heart, facing SEC charges" as if the charges are CURRENT. The case was dismissed nearly a year ago. This is active, current misinformation.

### Reddit r/CryptoCurrency
Multiple threads still label HEX as a "Ponzi scheme" and Richard Heart as a "fraud and scammer." The subreddit has a persistent anti-HEX bias with highly upvoted posts repeating debunked claims. The SEC dismissal is either ignored or downplayed.

### X/Twitter FUD Accounts
@GHutch106 (Jan 22, 2026): "often labeled a scam by critics" framing. @OG_TAngent (Jan 21, 2026): "widely labeled a Ponzi scheme by critics" citing Peter McCormack and Koinly. These accounts amplify the narrative without citing the court ruling.

### Yahoo Finance
Still hosts the original July 2023 article: "Hex founder used investor funds to buy $4.3M black diamond, SEC says" with no update or correction noting the case was dismissed.

### SEC.gov
The original press release (2023-143) is still live: "SEC Charges Hex Founder Richard Heart with Misappropriating Millions" with NO notation that the case was dismissed. This is the root source that all other outlets cite.

### Protos
Consistently hostile framing. March 2025 article titled "Richard Heart is still a fugitive, despite dismissal of SEC case" emphasizes Interpol/Europol status while burying the legal context.
